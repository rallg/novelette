# novelette
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novelette` is the canonical repository
for `novelette` document class.

Change of plan: Novelette will not be uploaded to CTAN for TeXlive 2024.
After 2024 is released, it may be uploaded. Then I can be sure that
any inadequacies are not frozen into the end of 2023, or the 2024 ISO.

CURRENTLY BETA TEST.

Novelette is intended for one thing only: Printed (to paper book) popular
fiction, written in a Western European language: murder mysteries,
historical romance, and so forth. Not graphic novels or Ebooks.
Very minimal knowledge of LaTeX will suffice. The command set is limited
to only what is needed for the purpose.

The `novelette` class is currently BETA test. Please do not fork
this repository at this point, unless you intend to assist development.
