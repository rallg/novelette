# novelette
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novelette` is the canonical repository
for `novelette` document class, which will (eventually) be available
in TeXlive and at CTAN, as package `novelette`. Uploads begin
in August 2023. Expected completion in September.

CURRENTLY ALPHA TEST.

Novelette is intended for one thing only: Printed (to paper book) popular
fiction, written in a Western European language: murder mysteries,
historical romance, and so forth. Not graphic novels or Ebooks.
Very minimal knowledge of LaTeX will suffice. The command set is limited
to only what is needed for the purpose.

The `novelette` class is currently ALPHA test. Please do not fork
this repository at this point, unless you intend to assist development.

The same developer created the `novel` document class, which does more,
but is harder to learn and use. It is already in TeXlive and at CTAN.

Update: September 12, 2023: Novelette is now alpha test stage. There will
be many tweaks and better documentation, but "it works". The Swainson
and Towhee fonts may have some changes. Language support for French
punctuation spacing is not yet enabled. Error traps need to be tested.
The [cover] option is being tested (appears to work).
