# novelette
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novelette` is the canonical repository
for `novelette` document class, which will (eventually) be available
in TeXlive and at CTAN, as package `novelette`. Uploads begin
in August 2023. Expected completion in September.

CURRENTLY PRE-ALPHA STAGE.

Novelette is intended for one thing only: Printed (to paper book) popular
fiction, written in a Western European language: murder mysteries,
historical romance, and so forth. Not graphic novels or Ebooks.
Very minimal knowledge of LaTeX will suffice. The command set is limited
to only what is needed for the purpose.

The `novelette` class is currently PRE-ALPHA test. Please do not fork
this repository at this point, unless you intend to assist development.
Although the document class works, there are several areas that need to be
examined, or are incomplete. Documentation is not ready. The pre-alpha mode
must be "draft" or "shade". Pre-alpha images must be "fake". Language support
for French punctuation spacing is not yet enabled.

The same developer created the `novel` document class, which does more,
but is harder to learn and use. It is already in TeXlive and at CTAN.

Update: September 1, 2023: Novelette is still in pre-alpha stage. The code
for processing covers is not complete. The placement of footnotes might
be tweaked. The accompanying fonts are likely to be tweaked. Documentation
does not exist, although there are several plain text doc files that can
give you an idea of where this is going.
