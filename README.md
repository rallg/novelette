# novelette
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novelette` is the canonical repository
for `novelette` document class, which will (eventually) be available
in TeXlive and at CTAN, as package `novelette`. Uploads expected
during September, 2023.

The same developer created the `novel` document class, which does more,
but is harder to learn and use. It is already in TeXlive and at CTAN.
