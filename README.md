# novelette
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novelette` is the canonical repository
for `novelette` document class, which will (eventually) be available
in TeXlive and at CTAN, as package `novelette`.

As of December 2023, the package works, and a number of
fine details are being revised. And, of course, there must be bug checks.
Upload to CTAN will not occur until early 2024.

Documentation lags. Will be fully documented before release.

CURRENTLY BETA TEST.

Novelette is intended for one thing only: Printed (to paper book) popular
fiction, written in a Western European language: murder mysteries,
historical romance, and so forth. Not graphic novels or Ebooks.
Very minimal knowledge of LaTeX will suffice. The command set is limited
to only what is needed for the purpose.

The `novelette` class is currently BETA test. Please do not fork
this repository at this point, unless you intend to assist development.

The same developer created the `novel` document class, which does more,
but is harder to learn and use. It is already in TeXlive and at CTAN.
