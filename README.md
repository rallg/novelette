# novelette
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novelette` is the canonical repository
for `novelette` document class, which will (eventually) be available
in TeXlive and at CTAN, as package `novelette`. Uploads begin
in August 2023. Expected completion in December.

CURRENTLY ALPHA TEST.

Novelette is intended for one thing only: Printed (to paper book) popular
fiction, written in a Western European language: murder mysteries,
historical romance, and so forth. Not graphic novels or Ebooks.
Very minimal knowledge of LaTeX will suffice. The command set is limited
to only what is needed for the purpose.

The `novelette` class is currently ALPHA test. Please do not fork
this repository at this point, unless you intend to assist development.

The same developer created the `novel` document class, which does more,
but is harder to learn and use. It is already in TeXlive and at CTAN.

Update: November 25, 2023: Novelette is now alpha test stage. There will
be many tweaks and better documentation, but "it works". Originally this
was intended for release (to beta stage) in October, but there have been
some excellent code enhancements, thus delay. The current code, here at
GitHub, will not be updated untill the enhancements have been more
thoroughly tested.
