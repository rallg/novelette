%% This file is loaded AtEndPreamble, when processing interior (not cover).

%% LIMITED COLOR, GRAY, or NO COLOR
%    In typo mode, Novelette loads the luacolor package, which in turn loads
%  standard LaTeX color (in the graphics bundle). That is for the limited
%  purpose of defining a color for typo flaws. Immediately after that
%  definition, all standard color is removed.
%    In shade mode, Novelette defines its own shades of gray, used only for
%  shading margins and other areas. No other colors are allowed.
%    Otherwise, no color is allowed. All text and images must be in black ink.
%  Option [cover] does something else, and does not load this file.
%%

%%% Load luacolor and color, in typo mode:
\ifthenelse{\equal{\@mode}{typo}\OR\equal{\@mode}{typo*}}{
  \definecolor{dkmag}{rgb}{.8,0,.8}
  \begingroup
  \color{dkmag}%
  \directlua{TypoColor = \the\LuaCol@Attribute}%
  \endgroup
}{}
\ifthenelse{\equal{\@mode}{typo*}}{%
  \definecolor{lt@gray}{rgb}{.7,.7,.7}%
  \color{lt@gray}%
}{}

%%% Prohibit LaTeX color commands:
%   There are several pre-defined LaTeX color commands. If the user attempts
% to invoke any of them, the ink remains black, and a Warning is issued.
