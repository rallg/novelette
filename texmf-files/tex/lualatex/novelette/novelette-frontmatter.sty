%%% FRONTMATTER.
%   Front matter, or frontmatter, is "about the book," not the story itself.
% In the case of popular fiction, not including the kind that is "soon to be
% a major motion picture," frontmatter is short. This is the only kind that
% Novelette supports.
%   Novelette front matter must have exactly six (6) pages. No more. No less.
% You must provide material for pages i, iii, iv, and v. If you do not provide
% page ii, then a blank page is automatically added there. You never provide
% page vi. A blank page is automatically added there.
%   Each page of frontmatter must be wrapped in a specific environment.
% These are pagei, pageii, pageiii, pageiv, pagev. You cannot create pagevi,
% because it is always blank.
%   Except when compiling a subdoc by itself, Novelette enforces rules for
% page order. If there is anything in frontmatter that is not within one of
% the specified environments, error. If any of pages i, iii, iv, v is missing,
% error. If pages are out of order, error.
%   Need more frontmatter? Need a table of contents? Too bad, so sad. If that
% is what you need, then Novelette is wrong for you.

%%% Re-define existing \frontmatter command:
\def\frontmatter{%
  \ifin@mainmatter%
    \nvt@err{Cannot use \noexpand\frontmatter after \noexpand\mainmatter}%
      {You wrote the commands in wrong order.^^J%
       Or did you use \noexpand\mainmatter twice?}%
  \else%
    \pagenumbering{roman}% Does not print.
    \pagestyle{empty}%
    \global\in@frontmattertrue%
    \setcounter{bookmatter}{1}%
  \fi%
}
%%%


%%% Utility:
\def\start@fullpage{%
  \in@fullpagetrue%
  \suppressfloats[t]% Ensures that a floated image does not go above opening.
  \suppressfloats[b]% Or beneath.
  \thispagestyle{empty}%
  \top@hat% Ensures that \vfil works as expected.

%%% Environment: pagei (half-title).
% Historically, the half-title was a dust cover for the real title page,
% in the era when books were printed and bound by different artisans.
% Nowadays it is a tradition; a book looks odd without it.
%   The half-title page contains only the book title (not subtitle or author),
% usually in the same style as it will appear on the title page, but smaller.
% It may be an image.

%%% Environment: pageii (frontispiece).
% Page ii is the frontispiece. It is optional. If you do not provide pageii,
% then a blank page will automatically be addded, where it would be.
%   The frontispiece is decorative. In museums, you can see antique books
% with fine illustrations on this page. But modern "instant bestseller" books
% may instead show a poster from the upcoming movie. Some books provide a list
% of works by the same author, but print-on-demand discourages that.
%   This is often a good place to put a map of the (real or imaginary) setting.
% For a historical romance, it might show the family tree of naughty nobility.
% For a murder mystery, it might show a diagram of the crime scene.
%   Limitations: Readers must be able to understand the story without seeing
% the frontispiece. The narration may not tell readers  to look here.
% It may not be the left side of a two-page title spread.
