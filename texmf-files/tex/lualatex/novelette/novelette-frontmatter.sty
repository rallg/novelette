%%% FRONTMATTER.
%   Front matter, or frontmatter, is "about the book," not the story itself.
% In the case of popular fiction, not including the kind that is "soon to be
% a major motion picture," frontmatter is short. This is the only kind that
% Novelette supports.
%   Novelette frontmatter contains exactly six pages, no more, no less.
% They are internally numbered with lowercase roman i-vi, but no page numbers
% are printed. You must provide content for pages i, iii, iv, v. You may put
% something on ii, but if you do not, Novelette automatically inserts a blank
% page there. You may not put something on page vi, because Novelette always
% inserts a blank page there. After vi, the next page is 1, the start of
% mainmatter, where you tell your story.

%%% Page i is the "half-title" page. It contains only the book title, without
% subtitle or author. It may be decorative. Typically, the half-title is in
% the same style as it will appear on the title page, but in a typesize that
% is smaller than the title page, yet larger than ordinary text. Historically,
% the half-title was a dust cover for the real title page. Now, traditional.

%%% Page ii is the frontispiece. If you have the artistry to create something
% such as a drawing of the main character, or scene from the story, you may
% put it here. You may put a map of an imaginary (or real) area, a diagram
% of a crime scene, a historical timeline, or somehing similar.
%   You may not directly refer to the frontispiece. Bad: "Jack looked at the
% map of Dingleville, shown near the front of this book." And you may not
% put something that is essential to understanding the story, such as an
% encrypted message (spy novel), where the reader is invited to decrypt it.
%   In most cases, omit page ii. Novelette will automatically insert a blank.

%   The text block is vertically centered.
%   No indents. Empty line between paragraphs.
