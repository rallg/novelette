Novelette is intended for popular fiction in Western European languages.
The Swainson/Towhee fonts do not include Eastern European characters
such as those with ogonek or breve. Even with different fonts, Novelette
will only allow you to load the hyphenation patterns for Western Europe.
This omission is intentional. Other language usually require program support
that Novelette does not have.

Under no circumstances should you attempt to use Novelette with a language
that has stacked diacritical marks. The algorithms used for alignment
do not take that into account. Of course, you can place any kind of writing
as an image. Since Novelette is intended only for printed (to paper) books,
the inability to magnify an image is irrelevant.

Since Novelette only loads hyphenation patterns, most languages do not have
regional variants. The exceptions are english, german, french, norwegian.

Swainson/Towhee includes vowels with macron. So if you are writing in Latin,
you may use these. They are also used in Hawaiian. Swainson/Towhee has
the okina (glottal stop) character, for spelling Hawai'i correctly.
