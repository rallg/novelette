<h2>Language</h2>

<p>In order to do <i>one thing well,</i> instead of <i>many things,</i>
Novelette is limited to the English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
and Catalan languages.</p>
<p>You may write the occasional word or phrase in another language. If you do,
it will be processed according to rules for the main language.</p>
<p>The language sets hyphenation patterns. In the case of French, it also
adds punctuation spacing. But it is not a spell-check. It does not format
dates and times, or money. You have to do that yourself.</p>


<h3>\language{<i>language</i>}[<i>option</i>]</h3>
<p>This command may be used in Preamble. If you do not set it, then Novelette
uses a generic hyphenation pattern (obsolete rules for American English).</p>
<p>The <i>language</i> is spelled lowercase, and must be one of:
<code>english french german italian spanish catalan</code>. Notice that you
cannot choose <i>francais</i> or <i>deutsch</i> or any other spellings.</p>
<p>Languages <code>italian spanish catalan</code> have no option, because
the rules are the same for all variants. Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>english</code> has options <code>[us]</code> and <code>[uk]</code>.
If red is a <i>color</i>, use <code>[us]</code>. If red is a <i>colour</i>,
use <code>[uk]</code>. Be sure to choose one of these. If you do not set
the option, then the older generic pattern will be used (not best).</li>
<li><code>french</li> has options for punctuation spacing. Without option,
spacing is the custom in France. Swiss option <code>[ch]</code> is like
France, except before the colon. Canadien option <code>[ca]</code> uses
narrower added space, where France would add more space.
Option <code>[x]</code> turns off added spacing.</li>
<li><code>german</code> has several options. <code>[1901]</code> uses
traditional spelling (with eszett). <code>[1996]</code> uses new spelling
(ss instead of eszett). <code>[1901x]</code> and <code>[1906x]</code> are
preferred, but require package <span class="nobreak"><i>dehyph-expl</i></span>
installed. <code>[ch]</code> uses Swiss spelling.</li>
<li>The optional argument may precede, or follow, the language.</li> 
</ul>


<h4>Swainson Fonts</h4>
<p>Novelette comes with Swainson fonts. These have the Latin-1 character set,
plus typographic characters, and a few others. Eastern European and other
world languages are generally unsupported.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawai`an:</b> The okina (glottal stop) is available at its correct
unicode location 0301, invoked as <code>{\okina}</code> (note the braces).
Vowels AEIOU are available with macron, also lowercase and small caps.</li>
<li><b>Catalan:</b> The middot is specifically designed as punt volat,
with uppercase, lowercase, and small caps variants. You may type the character
as a middot, or invoke it using macros <code>\L.L</code> and <code>\l.l</code>
(with period).</li>
<li>If you want ÃŸ type it. If you want ss instead, type it. The eszett is
also available capitalized, and small caps.</p>
<li><b>French:</b> Punctuation spacing is applied by changing the sidebearings
of those characters, instead of by adding space. The difference between
Swiss and non-Swiss is the amount of sidebearing for the colon character.
This is done automatically. If your text includes a space or non-breaking
space there, then your own space will be merged with the sidebearing,
to avoid extra-wide spacing.</li>
</ul>


<h4>\enable{libertinus} and \alt{<i>characters</i>}</h4>
<p>Swainson fonts have what you need, for writing in any of the languages
supported by Novelette. But what if you need to write the occasional
character from another language? You may use a fallback font.</p>
<p>Fallback is not automatic. You must first install TeX package
<code>libertinus-fonts</code>. Do this, even if those fonts are somewhere
in the operating system (beyond Tex).</p>
<p>Write this in Preamble: <code>\enable{libertinus}</code>. That tells
Novelette that you have the fonts. Without this command, Novelette will not
waste time looking for them. If you write them command but do not actually
have the fonts, the error is quick.</p> 
<p>In the document body, including footnotes (but not header/footer),
you may use <code>\alt{<i>characters</i>}</code> to print those characters
using Libertinus Serif, instead of Swainson. Libertinus Serif has a very
large character set, and Novelette will automatically tweak its characters
so that they blend well with Swainson.</p>
<p>If the alternate characters are in Italics, put the command for Italics
<i>inside</i> the <code>\alt</code> braces. Same with small caps.</p>
