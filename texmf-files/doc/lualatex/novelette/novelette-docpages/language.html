<h2>Language</h2>

<p>In order to do <i>one thing well,</i> instead of <i>many things,</i>
Novelette is limited to the English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
and Catalan languages.</p>
<p>You may write the occasional word or phrase in another language. If you do,
it will be processed according to rules for the main language.</p>
<p>The language sets hyphenation patterns. In the case of French, it also
adds punctuation spacing. But it is not a spell-check. It does not format
dates and times, or money. You have to do that yourself.</p>

<h3>\setlang[<i>option</i>]{<i>language</i>}</h3>
<p>This command may be used in Preamble. If you do not set it, then Novelette
uses a generic hyphenation pattern (obsolete rules for American English).</p>
<p>The <i>language</i> is spelled lowercase, and must be one of:
<code>english french german italian spanish catalan</code>. Notice that you
cannot choose <i>francais</i> or <i>deutsch</i> or any other spellings.</p>
<p>Languages <code>italian spanish catalan</code> have no option, because
the rules are the same for all variants. Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>english</code> has options <code>[us]</code> and <code>[uk]</code>.
If red is a color, use [us]. If red is a colour, use [uk]. Be sure to choose
one of these. If you do not set the option, then the older generic pattern
will be used (not best).</li>
<li><code>french</li> has one option, <code>[ch]</code> for Swiss. The only
difference is that [ch] applies less space following a colon.</li>
<li><code>german</code> has several options. <code>[1901]</code> uses
traditional spelling (with eszett). <code>[1996]</code> uses new spelling
(ss instead of eszett). <code>[1901x]</code> and <code>[1906x]</code> are
preferred, but require package <span class="nobreak"><i>dehyph-expl</i></span>
installed. <code>[ch]</code> uses Swiss spelling.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Swainson/Towhee Fonts</h4>
<p>The Swainson/Towhee fonts have the Latin-1 character set, plus typographic
characters, and a few others. Eastern European and other world languages
are generally unsupported.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawai`an:</b> The okina (glottal stop) is available at its correct
unicode location 0301, invoked as <code>{\okina}</code> (note the braces).
Vowels AEIOU are available with macron, also lowercase and small caps.</li>
<li><b>Catalan:</b> The middot is specifically designed as punt volat,
with uppercase, lowercase, and small caps variants. You may type the character
as a middot, or invoke it using macros <code>\L.L</code>  and <code\l.l</code>
(with period).</li>
<li><b>German:</b> OpenType feature ss03 changes the appearance of
eszett, so that it looks like ss. Also uppercase and small caps. The character
is still eszett, as far as hyphenation is concerned.</li>
<li><b>German:</b> OpenType feature ss01 lowers the height of umlauts on
uppercase AOU, so that they do not rise above the prevailing X-height.</li>
<li><b>French:</b> Punctuation spacing is applied by changing the sidebearings
of those characters, instead of by adding space. The difference between
Swiss and non-Swiss is the amount of sidebearing for the colon character.
This is done automatically. If your text includes a space or non-breaking
space there, then your own space will be merged with the sidebearing,
to avoid extra-wide spacing.</li>
<li><b>Irish:</b> Tironian et (Unicode 2044) is available.</li>
</ul>

<h4>\altfont[features]{Font Family} and \alt{text}</h4>
<p>In Preamble, you may set an <code>\altfont</code> intended when you need
a character that is not in Swainson/Towhee. It is invoked in the document
body using <code>\alt{text}</code> where needed.</p>
<p>This is not automatic. You must manually request any alt characters.
Automation would slow text processing.</p>
<p>A good choice is<code>\altfont{Libertinus Serif}</code>. This font
family can be installed as package
<span class="nobreak"><i>libertinus-fonts</i></span> in TeX. If you already
have it installed system-wdie, Novelette will (usually) find it.</p>
<p>Libertinus Serif is well-designed, has a large character set, and plays
nicely when mingled with Swainson/Towhee. But you can use another font,
if you wish.</p>
