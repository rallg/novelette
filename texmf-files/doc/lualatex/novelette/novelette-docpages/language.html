<h2>Language Settings</h2>

<p>Novelette allows only one language choice. You may write the occasional
word and phrase in any language, but if it needs hyphenation, it will be
hyphenated according to the rules of your single language.</p>
<p>During the Alpha stage of Novelette, language selection is subject
to change. In particular, the correct use of French punctuation spacing,
and language-specific quotation marks, is under development.</p>
<p>Novelette does not load either <i>babel</i> or <i>polyglossia</i>
packages, although it does use some code from each of them.</p>
<p>Your language must be Western European, although a few languages that
use the same character set (such as Finnish) are supported.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\setlang{<i>language</i>}[<i>option</i>]</code></p>
<p>The <i>language</i> is lowercase, and may be any of english, french,
german, and many others. Most languages do not have an option. In the case
of english, use option <code>[us]</code> or <code>[uk]</code> for best
results.</p>
<p>Note that the command is <code>\setlang</code>. If you attempt to use
something else, such as \lang or \language or \setlanguage,
then an error results.</p> 
<p>Novelette will use hyphenation, if the support package for your language
is installed. It will NOT format dates and times, or make other style
changes.</p>
<p>To do: Work on how French punctuation spacing, and various language
quotation marks, are enabled.</p>
