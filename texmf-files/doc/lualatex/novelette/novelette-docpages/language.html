<h2>Language Settings</h2>

<p>In order to do <i>one thing well,</i> instead of <i>many things,</i>
Novelette is limited to several major Western European languages.
If your language is not one of these, then Novelette does not
support it: <b>English French German Italian Spanish</b>.</p>
<p>English has variants for US and UK. French has variants for France and
Switzerland. German has variants for old (1901) and new (1996) spellings,
and Swiss.</p>
<p>Why no English for New Zealand? Why no French for Canada? Why no Spanish
for Mexico? Novelette language support is limited to hyphenation,
quotation style, and (in the case of French) punctuation spacing.
These are the same for most regions.</p>
<p>There is no automatic date/time format, or monetary format,
or chapter naming, or any of the other language features that LaTeX users
love or detest. In a work of popular fiction, you would hardly ever need these
things. Do them yourself.</p>
<p>You may write words or phrases in another language. However, they will
be processed according to the rules for the single, main language.</p>


<h4>\setlang[<i>option</i>]{<i>language</i>}</h4>
<p>This command is used in Preamble. Once a language is set, it cannot be
changed. If you do not set a language, then Novelette will use a default,
which is suitable only for testing and examples.</p>
<p>Languages and options are written as lowercase, using the English
spelling (<i>french</i>, not <i>French</i> or <i>francais</i> or 
<i>français</i>).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\setlang{italian}</code> has no options</li>
<li><code>\setlang{spanish}</code> has no options.</li>
<li><code>\setlang[<i>option</i>]{english}</code> allows these options:
<code>[us]</code> and <code>[uk]</code> for American and British spelling.
If red is a <i>color</i>, [us]. If red is a <i>colour</i>, [uk]. If you do not
set an option, then an older, generic American is used (not best).</li>
<li><code>\setlang[<i>option</i>]{french}</code> where the only option
is <code>swiss</code>. Either way, punctuation spacing follows French rules,
but the spacing before colon is less with [swiss].</li>
<li><code>\setlang[<i>option</i>]{german}</code> has several options.
<code>[1901]</code> uses traditional German (with eszett).
<code>[1996]</code> uses neue German (with ss).
<code>[1901x]</code> and <code>[1996x]</code> are more recent (preferred).
<code>[swiss]</code> uses Swiss.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Smart Quotes</h4>
<p>You may paste curly quotes, guillemets, and similar quotation marks,
from a character map. If your keyboard has language-specific keys for
quotation marks, you may use them. If you write your text in an application
that has smart quotes, then you may copy the text as-is into a Novelette
document</p>
<p>You may also use ordinary single and double quotation marks. Thanks to
the included <i>luaquotes</i> package, these will be automatically
converted to a quotation style that is standard for your set language.</p>
<p>Smart quotes will be wrong, if you begin a word with elision (missing
character, using apostrophe). English examples: 'bout (about) and 'til (until)
will be incorrectly processed as ‘bout and ‘til.
The sofware expects the start of a quotation. You must manually
write the necessary character (in English: ’bout, ’til), using a character
map. Note that this behavior is the same for most word processors.</p>


<h4>\luaquotestyle{<i>choice</i>}</h4>
<p>You may use this command in Preamble, if you wish to globally
<span class="nobreak">over-ride</span> the style of smart quotes. Choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>off</code> disables smart quotes.</li>
<li><code>en</code> converts "this" to “this”.
Default english, spanish, italian.</li>
<li><code>fr</code> converts "this" to
«<small>&nbsp;</small>this<small>&nbsp;</small>», with spacing.
Default french and swissfrench.</li>
<li><code>de</code> converts "this" to „this‟.
Default german (not swissgerman).</li>
<li><code>dech</code> converts "this" to «this». Default swissgerman.</li>
<li><code>degm</code> converts "this" to »this«.</li>
<li>You may always place any style of quotes, by writing the exact
characters.</li>
<ul>
