Overview

1. Ignore anything you read in online help. The difference between Novelette
and any other document class is so great, that general LaTeX advice does
not apply.

2. Novelette forces you to do some things in a particular way. This is partly
to keep you focused on writing your story, rather than on its TeX details.
And it is partly to do things that "work" rather than "maybe work."

3. Write your story in plain utf-8 text. Write now, apply TeX markup later.
You may use a word processor for spelling check, but be sure to export the
text as plain utf-8 text (without BOM).

4. In Novelette documentation, see the folder "interior-demo." Compile
interior-demo.tex using lualatex. If it fails, there is something missing from
your TeX setup.

5. Look at "interior-demo.tex" in a text editor. It is self-documenting.
See how it is organized by subfiles. Look at the subfiles. This is how
you should organize your book. Notice that there is very little TeX markup.

6. Toward the top of "interior-demo.tex" edit to "\mode{shade}" and compile
again, This time, the PDF has its margins grayed, and has some other
gray areas for alignment purposes.

7. Again edit that file, and change to "\mode{typo}". Now the PDF has some
of its text (lines or characters) tinted magenta. There is also a file
"interior-demo.typo" explaining what that means. For your own book, you may
use typo mode to identify places where re-writing is likely to improve
appearance.

8. Again edit, and change to "\mode{final}". The resulting PDF conforms to
PDF/X-1a:2001 with "US Web Coated (SWOP) v2" Output Intent, without attached
color profile. Many print-on-demand services like it this way.

9. Ready to write your story? Good! First, write it. Organize it as a number
of files that can be edited independently. Later, add TeX markup.
