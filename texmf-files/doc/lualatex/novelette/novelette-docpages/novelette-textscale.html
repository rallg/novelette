<h2>Text Scale</h2>
<p>This page does not discuss cover artwork.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\textscale[position]{scale}{text}</code></p>
<p>Novelette does not allow use of standard LaTeX size commands such
as <code>\small</code> and <code>\Large</code>. If you use any of those
commands, they will simply be ignored. This is necessary to preserve the
line grid.</p>
<p>On a display page, and in the opening environment, you may use the
<code>\textscale</code> command. It applies to a single line of text,
without wrapping. If you need multiple lines of scaled text, then you must
use multiple commands, one for each line.</p>
<p>Within <code>\textscale</code> you may change the font, use Italics,
and select OpenType features. But you may not nest another <code>textscale</code>,
and you may not place an image.</p>
<p>This command is used for creating prominent text, such as on the book title
page, and in chapter headings.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[position]</code> is one of l, c, r, o, i. This positions the text
left, center, right, outside, inside. Default c.</li>
<li><code>{scale}</code> is a number from 0.8 to 6. May be decimal. It is the
scale of the text, relative to the size of main text.</li>
<li><code>{text}</code> is the single line of text, to be scaled. Do not end
it with <code>\par</code>, because it is already included.</li> 
</ul>
<p>The scaled text will probably not have its baseline on the line grid.
However, the baseline is restored after scale, so any following main text
will be on line grid. This is especially important when <code>\textscale</code>
is used in chapter openings.</p>
