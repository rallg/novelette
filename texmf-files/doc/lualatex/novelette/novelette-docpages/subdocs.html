<a id="what"></a>
<h4>What Is a Subdoc?</h4>
<p>Your document may be contain one or more sub-documents, known as
<i>subdocs</i>. This allows you to create and edit a portion of your book
(such as a chapter) without touching any other portion.</p>
<p>When you compile the main document, all of its component subdocs
(and possibly sub-subdocs) are loaded, and they are compiled as a unit.</p> 
<p>You may also compile just one subdoc (and its own sub-subdocs). It will
read and use settings from the main document Preamble, so that the subdoc
automatically has the correct size and layout. The only difference is that
the subdoc does not know the number of its starting page, because it has
no knowledge of what will appear before it.</p>
<p>Novelette contains modified code from the <i>subfiles</i> package,
customized to play nicely with other Novelette code.</p>

<a id="create"></a>
<h4>Creating a Subdoc</h4>
<p>In most ways, a subdoc looks like an ordinary document, with
<code>.tex</code> file extension. It has <code>\documentclass</code>,
<code>\begin{document}</code>, and <code>\end{document}</code>. But there
are differences between a subdoc and the main document:</p>
<ul>
<li>A subdoc uses <code>\documentclass[<i>maindoc</i>]{novelette-subdoc}</code>
instead of the <code>novelette</code> document class.</i>
<li>The <code><i>maindoc</i></code> looks like an option, but it is required.
It is the path and filename for the main document, relative to the subdoc.</li>
<li>The <code><i>maindoc</i></code> must exist, and must use the
<code>novelette</code> document class. Its Preamble settings will be applied
to the subdoc.</li>
<li>The path to <code><i>maindoc</i></code> may use <code>../<code> to rise
one or more levels. This is the only exception to the Novelette rule that
prohibits rising levels. In any case, the path must be relative,
not absolute.</li>
<li>The subdoc has its own Preamble. But if you attempt to set anything such
as <code>\trimsize</code> there, it will be ignored. Only the main document
may contain the important settings.</p>
<li>The subdoc Preamble may contain its own <code>\mode</code>,
<code>\guides</code>, and <code>\sheetfeed</code>. They will only be obeyed
when compiling just the subfile. The main document will ignore them.</p>
<p id="starteven">When you compile just a subdoc, its PDF starts at page 1.
If you would like it to start at page 2, write <code>\starteven</code> in the
subdoc Preamble. That will insert a dummy page 1, before the subdoc pages.
This is ignored when compiling the main document.</li>
<li>When you compile just a subdoc, the result is never in final mode.
Its PDF metadata is modified, to indicate that it is not the whole document.
Page numbers are replaced by black dots, because the numbers are incorrect.
Header text, if used, is modified.</li>
</ul>

<a id="image"></a>
<h4>Paths for Images and Icons</h4>
<p>If a subdoc contains graphic elements (images or icons), the path to the
<code>.png</code> files is <i>relative to the main document</i>, no matter
how your folders are organized. The path is not relative to the subdoc.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>


<a id="subsub"></a>
<h4>Paths for Sub-Subdocs</h4>
<p>A subdoc may contain its own subdocs. The sub-subdoc files may be compiled
individually. Or, when the containing subdoc is compiled, it includes all
of its component subdocs.</p>
<p>The format for a sub-subdoc is the same as for any other subdoc:
The document class is <code>novelette-subdoc</code>, it requires the path
from the file to the main document, and its graphics path is relative to
the main document (not to any higher-level subdoc).</p>
<p>The path to a subdoc is relative to <i>the file that calls it</i>.
So, the path to a sub-subdoc is relative to its higher-level subdoc.</p>

<a id="folders"></a>
<h4>Suggested Folder Structure</h4>
<p>Everything must be contained within the same folder as the main document,
or a subfolder relative to the main document.</p>
<p>A good practice is to put all finished graphics (processed <code>.png</code>
files) in a single folder, relative to the main document. The obvious folder
name is <code>images</code>, but you may name it something else.</p>
<p>A good practice is to create folders that contain a few related files.
For example, if your book is a murder mystery, you might have a folder for
frontmatter, one for the chapters that create the setting, one for the chapters
that describe the crime and suspects, and one for the detection and solution.
But what you do is up to you.</p>
<p>Another good practice is to create an "other" folder that contains such
things as native-format graphics, alternative plots, backups, and whatever
else is useful. But if you are exchanging files with an editor, be sure that
you do not put any private information there.</p>
<p>Another good practice is to keep anything specific to the cover, in a
single folder.</p>

<a id="when"></a>
<h4>When a Subdoc is Compiled</h4>
<p>A subdoc knows the main document Preamble, but it does not know any
content of the main document body, except for itself and its own subdocs.</p>
<p>So if you are compiling Chapter 4 as a subdoc, it does not know about
the frontmatter or chapters 1-3, and does not know about anything after 4.
The PDF will start at page 1, even though Chapter 4 might start at page 63
in the full book. You may write <code>\starteven</code> in the subdoc
Preamble, so that a blank page is inserted before it (but not when compiling
the full document).</p>
<p>Instead of printing incorrect page numbers, Novelette prints the
"Numero" symbol &#x2116; where the page number would be. Also,
"*DRAFT*SUBDOC* will be printed in the upper left margin of each page.
And, the PDF metadata will not identify it as your book.</p>

<h4>Demo Files</h4>
<p>The demonstration files are in folder <i>novelette-demo</i>, which is
included with this documentation. Here are the
<a href="../novelette-demo/README-demo.html">instructions for compiling</a>
the demonstration interior and cover.</p>
