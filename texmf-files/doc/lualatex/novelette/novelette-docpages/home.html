<h2 class="title">Novelette Documentation</h2>

<p>Novelette is specifically intended for popular fiction, printed to paper,
most likely as softcover print-on-demand. If that is not what you are writing,
then Novelette is not for you.</p>
<p>In order to "do one thing well," language support is limited to English,
French, German, Italian, and Spanish. More extensive support would involve
code clutter. However, you may write the occasional word or phrase in nearly
any left-to-right language.</p>
