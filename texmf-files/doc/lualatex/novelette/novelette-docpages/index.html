<h2>Novelette Documentation Index</h2>

<h3>Basic Document Structure</h3>

<p>The top three lines of your document look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>% !TeX TS-program = lualatex<br>
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8<br>
\documentclass{novelette}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two lines are "magic comments" that tell some GUI programs
(such as TeXworks) how to process the document. They are ignored when
you process directly by command line.</p>
<p>Except when processing cover artwork, Novelette has no document class
options. Sizes and layout are selected by settings in Preamble.
These are listed below.</p>


<h3>Settings in Preamble</h3>

<p>Every document, even tests, <b>must</b> set the
<a href="novelette-booksize.html">book size</a>. There is no default value.</p>

<p>Every book requires
<a href="novelette-title-author.html">title and author</a>. If you do not
provide both of these, your document will be interpreted as a test file.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="novelette-mode.html">processing modes</a>.
Default mode is <code>draft</code>.</p>

<p>If you need PDF/X conformance, then choose an
<a href="novelette-intent.html">Output Intent</a>.
Default is <code>none</code>, which does not conform to PDF/X.<p>

<p>Every printer requires <a href="novelette-margins.html">margins</a> set
to at least some minimum width. If you do not set margins, Novelette will
provide commonly-used values as defaults.</p>

<p>Choose a <a href="novelette-layout">page layout</a> to your taste.
This determines whether or not there will be headers and/or footers, and how
they will appear. If you do not set layout, Novelette provides a default.</p>

<p>Novelette comes with its own <i>Swainson</i> and <i>Towhee</i> OpenType
fonts, which are specifically designed to look good in popular fiction.
They are used everywhere, by default. But if you wish to change the fonts,
or add more fonts for special purposes,
<a href="novelette-fonts.html">here is how</a>.</p>

<p>After it reviews your layout, Novelette will automatically choose
suitable values for main font size, and lines per page. If you want to use
something else, you may manually set the <a href="novelette-typelines.html">
font size and lines</a>.</p>

<p>Each chapter (and related content, such as Prologue) should start with
a <a href="novelette-openings.html">uniform appearance</a>, with chapter name
and (possibly) subname, above the start of main text. If you do not set this,
Novelette will use defaults.</p>

<p>When you are using <code>shade</code> mode, Novelette can display
<a href="novelette-guides.html">guides</a> in the side margins.</p>

<p>Novelette uses the <i>microtype</i> package for enhanced typesetting.
You may change its <a href="novelette-microtype.html">configuration</a>,
but do not change it unless you have expertise.</p>
