<h2>Novelette Documentation Index</h2>

<p>Documentation is a work in progress, until ready for release.</p>

<p class="noindent">This page describes settings for the book interior pages.
For information regarding cover artwork,
<a href="novelette-cover.html">go here</a>.</p>


<h3>Minimal Preamble</h3>
<p>Almost everything in Novelette has a pre-defined default setting.
You may be able to write your book without learning most commands.</p>
<p>This is the minimal document Preamble, enough to create a minimal working
example. The PDF will be in draft mode, which has correct typesetting but is
internally marked as draft:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<p class="codeblock"><code>
\documentclass{novelette}<br>
\booksize{w=<i>width</i>,h=<i>height</i>} % Required.<br>
\begin{document}<br>
<i>Contents of your book go here.</i><br>
\end{document}
</code></p>
</div> 


<h3>Complete Preamble</h3>
<p>Novelette defines a number of Preamble settings. Most of these settings
have reasonable defaults, so you do not need to set all of them.</p>
<p>You <b>must</b> set <code>\booksize</code>. This is the "trim size" of
the book interior pages. There is no default.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot use <code>\usepackage</code> or
<code>\RequirePackage</code> to add more packages. Novelette is very
restrictive, because added packages are likely to break other settings.
The packages you need are already included. If you wish to add something
else, then either do without it, or use a different document class.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all available Preamble settings, for book interior.
Click a setting, and you will navigate to its HTML documentation:</p>

<h3>Description of Preamble Settings</h3>

<a id="magic">
<h4>Magic Comments</h4>
<p>Although they are not required, it is helpful to write these two lines
at the very top of your document (including the % symbol):</p>
<p class="codeblock"><code>
% !TeX TS-program = lualatex<br>
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8
</code></p>
<p>Those are "magic comments" that are understood by some GUI programs,
such as TeXworks. They tell the program how to compile your document.</p>
<p>If you are compiling from command line, the magic comments are ignored.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmagic">^return</a></p>

<a id="documentclass">
<h4>\documentclass{novelette}</h4>
<p>With the exception of <a href="novelette-cover.html">cover artwork</a>,
there are no document class options. All settings are performed in Preamble
using the commands described here. This behavior is very different from
standard LaTeX document classes (such as <i>article</i> or <i>memoir</i>).</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#updocumentclass">^return</a></p>

<a id="titleauthor">
<h4>\title{<i>Book Title</i>} and \author{<i>Author Name</i>}</h4>
<p>If you are not producing your document in final mode, then you do not
need to provide title or author. Novelette will automatially insert
"Untitled Document" and "Anonymous Author", if you do not set them.</p>
<p>In final mode, you must provide both title and author. There are some
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are limited to the Latin-1 character set. This is partly due to
Novelette restrictions, and partly due to limitations of the print-on-demand
distribution system.</li>
<li>You cannot use curly single or double quotes, or curly apostrophe,
or dashes. These are not Latin-1 characters. You may
use the straight single and double quotes, and single hyphen.
So if your author is "Pat O'Doule", use the straight apostrophe.</li>
<li>TeX has numerous special characters, which must be escaped with backslash,
if you wish to write them in title or author. Codes
<code>\# \$ \% \& \{ \}</code> might be necessary.</li>
<li>Although TeX allows you to use the above backslashed characters in
title and author, your book distributor may disallow some or all of them.
Ask. For example, you may need to spell "Dollar" rather than use
"\$" in a title such as "The Thousand-Dollar Ransom". This has to do with
the way book titles are indexed.</li>
<li>The author may be a pseudonym (pen name). Be sure to use your real name
as Copyright Holder, on the Copyright Page, so you can prove that author
"Joe Fakename" is "Really You", in case of copyright infringement.</li>
<li>In general, print-on-demand services require that the book title and
author be identical, anywhere they appear. Whatever it says on the cover
artwork, must match the title page, the copyright page, and (if used)
the running page headers. If your full name is "Aloysius Lightlyrunningbear
Tornithengle", the disributor may allow you to abbreviate it as
"A. L. Tornithengle" in places. Ask them.</p>
<p>If you use a pseudonym, it is a marketing tool. For example, the
Novelette developer has a surname that does not harmonize with his
writing genre, so he uses a more harmonious pseudonym. Do not imagine that
you can hide your identity with a pseudonym. Most jurisdictions do not
allow that, and in any case your identity is revealed by other means.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uptitleauthor">^return</a></p>

<a id="subtitle">
<h4>\subtitle{<i>Subtitle of Book</i>}</h4>
<p>Your book does not require a subtitle. They are rarely used with popular
fiction, but are widely used for non-fiction as a marketing tool.</p>
<p>If you use a subtitle, it must follow the rules for title, as described
above. It must be identical, wherever the subtitle is written (cover,
title page, Copyright page). But normally you do not put the subtitle in
running page headers.</p>
<p>The subtitle does not appear in PDF metadata. However, it can be searched
in the book distribution database.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upsubtitle">^return</a></p>

<a id="mode">
<h4>\mode{<i>choice</i>}</h4>
<p>There are three modes: <code>draft shade final</code>.
Default is <code>draft</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>draft</b> mode typesets paragraphs, and numbers pages,
identical to how they will be typeset in final mode. So, you should do most
of your writing in draft mode, until the final editing stage.</li>
<li>In draft mode, you may use "fake" images. These are placeholders,
<a href="novelette-images.html">described here</a>.</li>
<li>If you use real images, they will appear in draft mode, even if they
are not eligible for final mode.</p>
<li>In draft mode, the internal PDF metadata will have DRAFT prepended
to the book title. This does not change the printed title.</p>
<li>The <b>shade</b> mode is also draft mode, but with some areas shaded gray,
so you can visualize alignment.
This is <a href="images/shade-noshade.html">illustrated here.</a></li>
<li>In <b>final</b> mode. Novelette performs several additional checks,
which consume additional time (especially if you use images). Final mode
is required for the PDF that you submit to the printer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmode">^return</a></p>

<a id="intent">
<h4>\intent{<i>choice</i>}</h4>
<p>There are five intents: <code>none SWOP FOGRA39 JC200103 custom</code>.
Default is <code>SWOP</code>, which is an abbreviation for "U.S. Web Coated
(SWOP) v2", the USA standard. FOGRA39 (acutally FOGRA39L) is one of several
European standards. JC200103 is used in Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you set intent as <b>none</b>, then the resulting PDF will not
declare that it conforms to PDF/X. It is still a good PDF, just not PDF/X.</li>
<li>Any other intent will write internal metadata, declaring that the PDF
conforms to PDF/X-1a:2001 standards. This is widely accepted (and sometimes
required) by print-on-demand services.</li>
<li>In any case, a color profile (*.icc file) will NOT be attached.</li>
<li>Do not use a <b>custom</b> intent, unless you are required to use a
particular intent that is not one of the choices. Then,
then you will need to write <a href="novelette-customintent.html">more
settings</a> in Preamble, according to industry specifications.</li>
<li>Dirty little secret: Usually, the intent is ignored by the printer.
But since it is part of the PDF/X specification, you must have it, unless
you do not need PDF/X. It is only important in commercial color offset
printing, which is not the technology that will be used for your book.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upintent">^return</a></p>

<a id="booksize">
<h4>\booksize{w=<i>width</i>,h=<i>height</i>}</h4>
<p>You <b>must</b> set booksize. There is no default. The setting requires
both width and height, measured in units of inches (in) or millimeters (mm)
or centimeters (cm).</p>
<p>Book size is known as <b>trim size</b>. This is because larger paper is fed
into the print machine, then trimmed (cut) to actual size, during binding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your print service will offer you a choice of several standard trim sizes.
In the USA, <code>w=5.5in,h=8.5in<code> is a popular size for softcover
fiction. In the UK, perhaps B-format at <code>w=129mm,h=198mm</code>
would be your choice.</li>
<li>Be sure to select off-white (cream, creme) paper. Not white.</li>
<li>Unless you know what you are doing, avoid the small "mass market" and
"Pocket" sizes. Those are generally used only by commercial publishers with
"instant best-seller" books (many of which will be discarded, at a loss).</li>
<li>Unless you know what you are doing, do not choose "expanded distribution"
(or similar term) when you sign with the print service. You do not want
booksellers to order copies (at your expense) in hopes they may sell,
with your loss if they do not sell.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upbooksize">^return</a></p>

<a id="sheetfeed">
<h4>\sheetfeed{<i>choice</i>}</h4>
<p>Do not use the sheetfeed setting, unless you need it. Incorrect use of
this setting may cause the printer to reject your PDF, or print it at the
wrong size.</p>
<p>Choices: <code>booksize letter A4</code>. Default booksize.</p>
<ul>
<li>When sheetfeed is <b>booksize</b> (default), the PDF page size is identical
to the booksize setting. This is how most print services want it.</li>
<li>When the sheetfeed is <b>letter</b> or <b>A4</b>, the pages are centered
(vertically and horizontlly) in the larger PDF paper size. This may be useful
if you are printing a private copy on your home printer, for manual editing.
A few print services will request sheetfeed, if there is a human editor.</li>
<li>Caution: If you use sheetfeed only for personal printing, be sure to
un-set it before creating the final PDF.</li>
<li>Whether or not you use sheetfeed, the PDF will have internal metadata
defining its "TrimBox", where the trimmed pages are located.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upsheetfeed">^return</a></p>

<a id="margins">
<h4>\margins{<i>t=T,o=O,b=B,i=I</i>}</h4>
<p>T, O, B, and I are measured in inches (in) or millimeters (mm).
T is the top margin, O is the outside margin, B is the bottom margin,
and I is the inside (spine) margin.</p>
<p>Default: <code>t=13mm,o=13mm,b=13mm,i=16.2mm</code>. This complies with
the minimum values requested by many (not all) print services in the USA
and Europe. Also, they look good, unles your booksize is very large or
very small.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, I is larger than O, because I must include the area that will
be hidden from view when the book is bound (glued).</li>
<li>Margins are the white space surrounding the printable page area. In other
words, nothing is placed in the margins. If you layout has header and/or
footer, they will be printed in the printable rectangle surrounded by the
empty margins. This method differs from some word processors, which place
header/footer within the top/bottom margin areas.</li>
<li>There is no separate setting for gutter.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmargins">^return</a></p>

<a id="typesize">
<h4>\typesize{<i>size</i>}</h4>
<p>The typesize is the font size of main body text. It is measured in units
of TeX points (pt) or PostScript points (bp).</p>
<p>If you do not set typesize, Novelette will set it for you. This is often
best. After reading other settings, Novelette will calculate a default
typesize from 11pt-12bp, based on certain reading standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>The typesize is a global setting. You may not change it later in the
book. However, there are some locations (such as chapter names) where the
text is scaled to another size.</li>
<li>A typical default calculates typesize near 11.4pt.</li>
<li>You cannot set the leading, known to TeX as "baselineskip". It will be
calculated from other settings.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uptypesize">^return</a></p>

<a id="lines">
<h4>\lines{<i>integer</i>}</h4>
<p>This sets the number of lines per page, in main body text. It does not
count the header and/or footer.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to set lines. After reading other settings, Novelette
will calculate a default number of lines, typical for popular fiction.
The result is likely to be in the range 28-35.</li>
<li>This is a global setting. You cannot change it later in the book.
However, special <a href="novelette-displaypage.html">display pages</a>
may disregard the line grid.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uplines">^return</a></p>

<a id="layout">
<h4>\layout{<i>style=S,hgap=H,fgap=F,num=N</i>}</h4>
<p>This sets the page layout. You may (and will) locally over-ride the
style, for individual pages. Otherwise, it is a global setting.</p>
<p>Default: <code>style=2,hgap=.5,fgap=.5,num=m</code>. This creates a layout
that has header and footer, with centered header text, centered
page number in the footer, and page numbers using the same type style
as main text.</p>
<p>There are many ways to combine the four layout settings.
<a href="images/layout-gallery.html">Here is a gallery</a> of some
possible combinations.</p>
<p>The <b>style</b> sets the header/footer style number:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>style=1</code> provides a footer, but no header. Page numbers
are centered in the footer.</li>
<li><code>style=2</code> provides header and footer. Running header text
is centered. Page number is centered in the footer.</li>
<li><code>style=3</code> provides header and footer. Running header text
aligns to outside margin. Page number, in footer, aligns to outside margin.
This is a very unusual style.</li>
<li><code>style=4</code> provides only header. Running header text is
centered. Page number is at outside margin.</li>
<li><code>style=5</code> is like style 4, with added vertical bar at a
fixed distance from the margin. This style is widely-used.</li>
<li><code>style=6</code> is like style 4, with added slash / separated from
the page number by a space. This style is frequently seen in technical
works, but rarely in popular fiction.</li>
<li><code>style=7</code> provides only header. Both running text and
page number are centered. They are separated by a spaced slash / with
the page number twoard the outside. This style may be useful with smaller
book sizes, because the header is less likely to crowd main text.</li>
<li>The above choices are the only styles that regularly appear in
popular fiction. If you need something else, such as underlined header or
double-line header, then do not use Novelette.</li>
<li><code>style=0</code> exists only for developer use. It has
no header or footer, and no page numbers.</li>
<li>You cannot place images in header or footer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>hgap</b> is a number from 0 to 1, usually decimal. It is the
amount of additional vertical space (measured as multiple of ordinary lines)
between header and main body text.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hgap=0</code> can be set, but it looks bad. Avoid it.</li>
<li><code>hgap=1</code> provides a full empty line between header and
main body text. Unless your booksize is large, hgap=1 might be too large.</li>
<li><code>hgap=.5</code> is the default. It looks good with common book
sizes.</li>
<li>If the layout style does not use a header, then hgap is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom:.5em">The <b>fgap</b> is like <code>hgap</code>,
except it appliesbetween main text and footer.</p>
<p>The <b>num</b> sets how page numbers will appear.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>num=m</code> uses the same page numerals as in main text.
This is the default.</li>
<li><code>num=l</code> uses lining numerals, if the font has them.</li>
<li><code>num=o</code> uses oldstyle numerals, if the font has them.</li>
<li>You may add <code>i</code> to any of the above codes. This will change
from default Regular, to Italic.</li>
<li>The <code>num</code> setting does not determine whether page numbers
are lowercase roman letters, or arabic numerals. That will depend on
whether the pages are in frontmatter, or mainmatter.</li>
<li>If you have frontmatter pages that display the page number (unusual),
they will respond to the <code>i</code> setting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uplayout">^return</a></p>

<a id="guides">
<h4>\guides{<i>up to four comma-separated integers</i>}</h4>
<p>Guides are little gray rectangles, visible in the side margins, only when
<code>\mode{shade}</code> is set. The use of guides is optional. Default
is no guides.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may set up to four guide pairs.</li>
<li>Format: <code>\guides{J,K,L,M}</code> where J, K, L, and M are integers
(if you use all four guide pairs).</li>
<li>The integer is the line number of main body text, at which the guide
will appear. Header and footer are ignored. So, a guide at 5 sets the
markers aligned with line 5 from the top of main text.</li>
<li>The bottom of the guide rectangle is at the baseline of main text.
The top of the guide rectangle is at the x-height of normal main text.</li>
<li>Guides are global. They are set the same on every page.</li>
<li>The purpose of guides is to provide a visual reference, particularly
at chapter openings. There, the chapter name (and possibly description)
will be placed at a certain number of lines from the top, and main text
will begin lower down the page. Align them with the guides you set.</li>
<li>Guides do not force alignment. They are only a visual reference.</li>
<li>Display pages, such as the book title page, will often not be aligned
to the guides.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upguides">^return</a></p>

<a id="typeface">
<h4>\typeface{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>The "typeface" is also known as the "main font". It is used in main
body text, and is also used anywhere you do not locally select a different
font.</p>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setmainfont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Font Family</code> might be something such as "Adobe Garamond
Pro" or "Libertinus Serif" or "Clara" or "Crimson Pro Regular". It does not
need to be a LaTeX font. You may use any OpenType or TrueType font, as long
as it is licensed for commercial usage.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to determine whether the chosen font is
properly licensed (free or paid) for your purpose. Do not use GNU Public
License fonts, unless their license comes with an explicit
Font Exception Clause.</li>
<li>The default typeface is "Swainson", which comes with Novelette.
If you use Swainson, then the "Towhee" font will be used for footnotes.</li>
<li>Some fonts, such as "Latin Modern Roman", are not designed for the purpose
of popular fiction. They do not offer the same flowing readability as fonts
designed for the purpose.</li>
<li>The font family does not need Bold or BoldItalic. These are never used
in the main text of popular fiction.</li>
<li>Some OpenType features are pre-selected: <code>kern,liga,onum</code>.
That is, kerning, common ligatures, oldstyle numerals. You do not need to
write these features.</li>
<li>When the font is used in some locations, such as page headers, openings,
and display pages, the ligatures are not used. This is because such text
is often loose (greater space) or enlarged.</li>
<li>The TeX-specific "TeX Ligatures" are also pre-selected.</li>
<li>Additional information regarding Opentype Features is
<a href="novelette-opentype.html">on another page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uptypeface">^return</a></p>

<a id="sansfont">
<h4>\sansfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setsansfont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default sansfont is Swainson (which is serif), same as typeface.</li>
<li>In principle, this font should be be one of the sans-serif fonts.
In practice, you may set any font, including those that have serifs.</li>
<li>The sans font might be useful in special locations, such as chapter
openings, and display pages.</li>
<li>Also see the above information for typeface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upsansfont">^return</a></p>

<a id="monofont">
<h4>\monofont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setmonofont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>You probably will not  need to use monospaced text.</li>
<li>The default monofont is "Latin Modern Mono", which comes with LaTeX.</li>
<li>Unlike other fonts, the monofont default features do not include
kerning, ligatures, or oldstyle numbers.</p>
<li>A monospaced font is normally used for mathematics and tables, which
are outside the purpose of Novelette. But if you need a monospace font,
you may use it for special purposes.</li>
<li>Some monospace fonts are designed to look like traditional typing, from a
mechanical typewriters. Others have a more modern design, and are used by
computer programmers.</li>
<li>Also see the above information for typeface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmonofont">^return</a></p>

<a id="altfont">
<h4>\altfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets an "alternate font" that you
can locally use, when you need characters that are not in the main font.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default altfont is Swainson, same as typeface. But this is not
helpful. You should select your own alternate font.</li>
<li>A good general-purpose altfont is "Libertinus Serif". This font has a
large character set, and a design style that is inconspicious (usually) when
mingled with a different main font.</li>
<li>You can install Libertinus Serif via your TeX package manager. It is
package "libertinus-fonts" (not any other package with similar name).
You will still need to set <code>\altfont</code>.</li>
<li>Use of the altfont is not automatic. You must manually request it where
you need it, in the text: <code>\alt{This text uses altfont}</code>.</li>
<li>Also see the above information for typeface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upaltfont">^return</a></p>

<a id="dramafont">
<h4>\dramafont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets a "dramatic font" that you
can locally use, for special effect. That might be on the book title page,
or in chapter openings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not necessarily need a dramatic font.</li>
<li>The default dramafont is Swainson, same as typeface.</li>
<li>To use it: <code>\drama{This is dramatic text}</code>.</li>
<li>Also see the above information for typeface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#updramafont">^return</a></p>

<a id="decofont">
<h4>\decofont{<i>font-filename.otf</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets a "decorative font" that you
can locally use, for dingabts or other decorative elements.</p>
<p>Unlike the other font settings, decofont does not select a font family.
It selects a single font file, which you choose by its full file name,
with extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not necessarily need a decofont.</li>
<li>The default decofont is Swainson, same as typeface. Note that Swainson
does not have any decorative characters.</li>
<li>Unlike other fonts, the decofont default features do not include
kerning, ligatures, or oldstyle numbers.</li>
<li>To use it: <code>\deco{<i>character</i>}</code>.</li>
<li>Also see the above information for typeface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#updecofont">^return</a></p>

<a id="namestyle">
<h4>\namestyle{align=A,font=F,scale=S}</h4>
<p>The <code>\namestyle</code> setting provides a uniform appearance for
text that uses the <code>\name</code> command.
<a href="images/namedesc.html">Example here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>align=<i>code</i></code> determines the horizontal alignment.
The code is one of <code>l c r o i</code>
(left, center, right, outside inside). Default align=c.</li>
<li><code>font=<i>code</i></code> determines which font will be used for the
name text. The code is one of <code>main sans mono alt drama deco</code>.
Default font=main.</li>
<li><code>scale=<i>number</i></code> sets the scale of name text, relative
to main font size. Default scale=1.6, which looks nice in chapter names.</li>
</ul>

<a id="descstyle">
<h4>\descstyle{align=A,font=F,scale=S}</h4>
<p>The <code>\descstyle</code> setting provides a uniform appearance for
text that uses the <code>\desc</code> command.
<a href="images/namedesc.html">Example here</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>The use of <code>\descstyle</code> is like that of <code>\namestyle</code>,
except that this default scale=1.25.</li>

<a id="setmicrotype">
<h4>\setmicrotype{<i>settings</i>}</h4>
<p>Novelette uses the <code>microtype</code> package for improved appearance
of body text. Since the package does not load until after Preamble,
this command provides a way to "PassOptionsToPackage" when
<code>microtype</code> loads.</p>
<p>If you do not know what that means, simply ignore it. Novelette is pre-set
to values that are good for its purpose. You do not need this command.</p>
<p>If you do wish to play with this command, Novelette will not let you
use the microtype draft mode. Microtype will always be in its own final mode,
no matter what you choose via <code>\mode</code> in Novelette.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upsetmicrotype">^return</a></p>

<a id="myparindent">
<h4>\myparindent{<i>size</i>}</h4>
<p>Novelette pre-sets the default paragraph indent at <code>1.5em</code>.
That looks good for the purpose intended. But if you need a different default
value, use <code>\myparindent</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>\myparindent{10pt}</code> for a small indent.</li>
<li>This is a global setting. If you need to locally change the indent,
that is performed using other commands in body text.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmyparindent">^return</a></p>

<a id="warnpercent">
<h4>\warnpercent{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>TeX uses the percent character % for comments. Anything following %,
on the same line of raw text (prior to typesetting) will be ignored.</p>
<p>If you need to print the percent character, you may use a
backslash <code>\%</code> there.</p>
<p>Default <code>\warnpercent{off}</code> does nothing.
But <code>\warnpercent{on}</code> issues a Warning if you use the
un-escaped % anywhere in body text. It does not warn for Preamble.
This is a way to detect accidental
use of % (which means comment) when you really meant to print %.</p>
<p>In body text, you may use <code>\memo{This does not print.}</code>
where you need it. The difference between memo and %, is that after the
memo completes, anything following it will print.</p>
<p>If you use this to issue a Warning, then the PDF will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>The <i>novelette-docpages</i> directory has a file named "warnmebro.tex".
You may edit it with warnpercent on or off, for comparison.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upwarnpercent">^return</a></p>

<a id="warnquotes">
<h4>\warnquotes{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>TeX normally converts straight double quotes " to right curly quotes ”.
Alas, some writers (<i>moi</i>) are in the habit of typing " with the
expectation that a smart-quotes feature will alternately convert them
to left and right curly quotes, as needed. That is not what TeX does,
so the print will be wrong. This is often hard to notice.</p>
<p>Default is <code>\warnquotes{off}</code>.
If you use <code>\warnquotes{on}</code> then Novelette will issue a Warning if
you wrote " anywhere in the document body. It does not warn for Preamble.</p>
<p>Since Novelette uses UTF-8 text encoding, you may directly paste left
and right curly quotes from a character map. Or, you may use <code>``</code>
(two acute characters, also known as backticks) for left curly quotes, and
two <code>''</code> (straight single quotes, also known as straight
apostrophe) for right curly quotes.</p>
<p>If you use this to issue a Warning, then the PDF will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>This documentation directory has a file named "warnmebro.tex".
You may edit it with warnquotes on or off, for comparison.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upwarnquotes">^return</a></p>

<a id="warnalert">
<h4>\warnalert{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>Novelette sometimes writes ALERT messages to the log file. These are
not Errors, or Warnings. Usually, an ALERT means that you set something
to an unusual value. Did you really mean that, or not?</p>
<p>Default <code>\warnalert{off}</code>. If you use <code>\warnalert{on}</code>
then a Warning will be issued if there were any Novelette-caused ALERTs.</p>
<p>It may be that the ALERT was thrown by a situation that you should fix.
Or maybe it is what you intended, so no need to fix it. When you are satisfied
that nothing needs to be fixed, turn <code>\warnalert{off}</code>.</p>
<p>If you use this to issue a Warning, then the PDF will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>This documentation directory has a file named "warnmebro.tex".
You may edit it with warnalert on or off, for comparison.</p>

<a id="applprod">
<h4>\application{<i>string</i>} \producer{<i>string</i>}</h4>
<p>PDF metadata includes "application" and "producer". The "application" is
the software that created the text (perhaps a word processor), and the
"producer" is the application that converted the text to PDF (perhaps a
Distiller). Modern software does both at once.</p>
<p>Novelette is pre-set to use "Novelette" as application, and as producer.
Normally, you never need to change this. But if your PDF will be sent through
a workflow that expects a specific string for either application or
producer, you may use these commands to change the metadata.</p>
