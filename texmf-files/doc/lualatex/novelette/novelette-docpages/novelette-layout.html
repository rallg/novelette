<h2>Book Size and Page Layout</h2>

<p>The width and height of book interior pages is its <b>trim size</b>,
because larger paper is fed into the printing machine, then trimmed (cut)
to final size during binding.</p>
<p>Always use off-white (cream, creme) paper for popular fiction.
In the USA, popular fiction often uses trim size 5.5in width, 8.5in height.
In the UK, perhaps a popular size is B-format, at 129mm width, 198mm height.
The choice is yours. Look at other books in your genre.</p>


<a id="booksize">
<h4>Book Size</h4>
<p>The Novelette term for trim size is <b>book size</b>, to avoid confusion
with similar terms. It is set using the <code>\booksize</code> command in
Preamble. You must set it. There is no default size.
Failure to set it will produce an immediate fatal error.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\booksize{w=<i>width</i>,h=<i>height</i>}</code></li>
<li>Width and height have units of <b>in</b> (inches) or <b>mm</b>
(millimeters).</li>
<li>Height may not be less than width.</li>
<li>Novelette does not check the size against a standard list. Unless the
setting is absurdly small or large, what you set is what you get.</li>
</ul>

<a id="sheetfeed">
<h4>Sheet Feed</h4>
<p><i>Do not use this command unless necessary.</i></p>
<p>Novelette normally produces PDF page size that is equal to the booksize
(trim size). This is how nearly all print services want it.</p>
<p>If you are printing a copy on your home printer, perhaps for manual
editing, most printers will have no problem placing the PDF pages on
whatever paper you feed. But in the event that your printer does not know
what to do, then sheetfeed may help. Be sure to remove this command,
before the final PDF.</p>
<p>In rare instances, your print service may ask you to do this, usually
if there is a human editor. Do not do it unless explicity requested.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\sheetfeed{<i>paper</i>} % paper is <i>letter</i> or <i>A4</i>.</code></p>

<a id="margins">
<h4>Margins</h4>
<p>You do not need to set margins, since Novelette has defaults. But if you
wish to do it yourself...</p>
<p>In Novelette, the four margins are boundaries of a rectangle.
This rectangle is the printable area. All content (including header, footer,
main text, and images) must fit within the printable area.</p>
<p>Some word processors do not define "margins" that way. Instead, they will
place the header within the area of the top margin, and place the footer
within the area of the bottom margin. If the print service suggests margins,
be sure that the values account for the way Novelette does it, not the way
a word processor does it.</p>
<p>All print dervices require some minimum margin values. You cannot print
anything too close to the page edge or the binding, because print-on-demand
has more manufacturing variation than most other methods. You cannot use
interior bleed (images trimmed at page edge).</p>
<p>As far as the Novelette developer knows, margins of 13mm at top, outside,
and bottom, and 16.2mm at inside, will meet the minimum margins widths of
print-on-demand services in the USA and Europe. These are the defaults.
If you are allowed to use narrower margins, or if you wish to use wider
margins, then set them yourself in Preamble.</p>
<p>In general, the inside margin is wider than the outside margin, by about
3mm or 0.125in, to allow for glue at the spine binding. There is no separate
setting for "gutter".</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\margins{t=<i>top</i>,o=<i>outside</i>,b=<i>bottom</i>,i=<i>inside</i>}</code></li>
<li>Each margin has units of <b>in</b> (inches) or <b>mm</b> (millimeters).</li>
<li>If you set any margin, then you must set all four of them.</li>
<li>The printable content should look like it is centered in the page.
Artistic effects, such as an extra-wide outside or bottom margin, may be
rejected by the print service. This is because the humans who handle the pages
have never seen your book before, and may think that the printer was mis-fed,
if the pages are visibly off-center.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Type Size (Main Font Size)</h4>
<p>Novelette uses the term <b>typesize</b> to mean the size of the main
body text, measured in units of <b>pt</b> (TeX points), or <b>bp</b>
(PostScript points).</p>
<p>You do not need to set typesize, since Novelette will guess a value
(11 to 12 pt, usually in between) based on various other settings.
It is often best to accept the guessed value. But if you wish to do it
yourself...</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\typesize{<i>size</i>}</code></li>
<li>The <i>size</i> has units of <b>pt</b> or <b>bp</b>.</li
<li>This is a Preamble setting. You cannot change it later in the book.
However, larger or smaller text will be used in special locations.</p> 
<li>You cannot set the leading, known to TeX as <i>baselineskip</i>. It will
automatically be calculated from other settings.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uptypesize">^return</a></p>


<a id="lines">
<h4>Lines Per Page (Main Text Block)</h4>
<p>You do not need to set the number of lines per page. Novelette will
calculate a good value, based on other settings. But if you wish to do it
yourself...</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\lines{<i>integer</i>}</code></li>
<li>The <i>integer</i> is lines per page in the main text block, not counting
header or footer.</li>
<li>This is a Preamble setting. You cannot change it later in the book.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uplines">^return</a></p>


<h4>Header and/or Footer Layout</h4>
<p>Although Novelette has a default layout, it is not always best. So be sure
to read this, and choose a layout that works for you.</p>
<p>Novelette does not allow you to construct your own layout. You must
choose from several pre-defined styles. Just about every book, in the
popular fiction of public libraries, will have one of these styles. Yes, the
developer did look through the shelves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\layout{style=<i>S</i>,hgap=<i>H</i>,fgap=<i>F</i>,num=<i>N</i>}</code></li>
<li><i>S</i> is an integer 1-7. It chooses whether layout has header and/or footer,
and alignment of content. The choices are described and illustrated in the
<a href="images/layout-styles.html">gallery of layout styles</a>.
Default style is 2.</li>
<li><i>H</i> is a number from 0 to 1 (usually in between). It sets the
extra vertical space between header and main text, measured in lines.
Value 0 is usually not practical. Value 1 inserts a full empty line.
Default value is 0.5, which is reasonable for many books.</li>
<li><i>F</i> is like hgap, except it sets space between main text block
and footer. Default 0.5.</li>
<li><i>N</i> is a one-letter or two-letter code, chosen from these
possibilities: <code>m l o i mi li oi</code>. If the code contains
<code>i</code>, then page numbers (roman or arabic) will be italicized.
If the code contains one of <code>m l o</code>, then arabic numbers will
use the same style as main text (m), or lining numerals (l), or oldstyle
numerals (o). This assumes that your choice is actually available in
the font. Default is <code>m</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a id="guides">
<h4>Guides</h4>
<p>Guides can assist with visual alignment, on pages that use white space,
such as chapter openings.
You can see <a href="images/shade-noshade.html">an example</a>.</p>
<p>Guides do not force anything. They do not affect the layout.
How you set guides, and whether or not you obey them, is up to you.
There are no default guides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\guides{<i>up to four comma-separated integers</i>}</code></li>
<li>The integers are number of main text lines, from top of main text.<li>
<li>Example: <code>\guides{8,12,15,22}</code> sets four guide pairs.</li>
<li>This is a Preamble setting. It cannot be changed later in the book.</li>
<li>Guides may be set regardless of mode. But they are only visible when
in <code>shade</code> mode.</li>
<li>The bottom edge of guides is at main text baselines. The top edge is
as the normal x-height.</li>
</ul>
