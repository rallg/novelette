<a href="intro"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>An <i>environment</i> starts with <code>\begin{<i>something</i>}</code>
and ends with <code>\end{<i>something</i>}</code>. In many cases, the
<code>\begin</code> tells the compiler to use certain settings, which will
be applied until <code>\end</code>.</p>
<p>LaTeX has many built-in environments, most of which are only relevant
to math or academic works. Novelette disallows them. If you attempt to use
a disallowed environment, then an error will result.</p>
<p>Use only the environments described on this page. Note that
<code>\frontmatter</code>, <code>\mainmatter</code>, and
<code>\backmatter</code> are not environments (as described here) because
they are not applied using <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code>.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="document"></a>
<h4>Environment: document</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{document}</code> ... <code>\end{document}</code></h5>
<p>This environment is required. Its contents are the "document body" which
will print. The Preamble precedes <code>\begin{document}</code>. Anything
written after <code>\end{document}</code> is ignored, so you may write notes
to yourself there, if you wish.</p>
<p>The <code>\begin</code> and <code>\end</code> are not just signposts.
These commands invoke many other commands that apply your settings and
gather information.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="fullpage"></a>
<h4>Environment: fullpage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{fullpage}</code> ... <code>\end{fullpage}</code></h5>
<p>This is a generic full-page environment. It is suitable for such things
as half-title page, title page, maps (if not mid-chapter), and other
purposes where there is no particular format. Do not confuse it with a
full-page floating image.</p>
<ul>
<li>It begins a new page. Whatever follows its end, will be on a new page.</li>
<li>You may use nearly any style command, as well as images and icons.</li>
<li>If page layout has a header, it will be empty. If page layout has a footer,
it will be empty in frontmatter, but print the page number in mainmatter.
This behavior may be changed using <code>\thispagestyle</code> within the
environment.</li>
<li>You may place an <code>upperpage</code> environment at the top of
<code>fullpage</code>. This is useful if the lower portion of the page has
ordinary text, and you wish that text to be on-grid.</li>
<li>If you place an image in <code>fullpage</code>, it cannot float. It will
appear where you write the <a href="images-icons#image"><code>\image</code></a>
command.</li>
<li>If <code>fullpage</code> does not fit on a single page, it will extend to
another page (automatically fullpage). An alert is issued, because you
might not have intended more than one page.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="copyrightpage"></a>
<h4>Environment: copyrightpage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{copyrightpage}</code> ... <code>\end{copyrightpage}</code></h5>
<p>You do not need to use this environment, if you prefer to style the
copyright page yourself. But it is recommended, because it pre-styles its
contents, and thus involves less coding on your part.</p>
<ul>
<li>It begins a new page. Whatever follows its end, will be on a new page.</li>
<li>The page does not print header or footer.</li>
<li>Paragraphs are not indented, and are separated by a blank line.
Use <code>\\</code> to break lines mid-paragraph.</li>
<li>Text is horizontally centered. Hyphenation is disabled. Default numerals
are lining.</li>
<li>You may style text using<code>\ital \smcp \allsmcp \onum \lnum
\smalltext</code> commands.</li>
<li>You may <i>not</i> use <code>upperpage</code>, <code>\name</code>,
<code>\subname</code>, or any of the <code>\formatX</code> commands.</li>
<li>You may use <a href="images-icons.html#icon"><code>\icon</code></a>,
but <i>not</i> <a href="images-icons#image"><code>\image</code></a>.</li>
<li>Do not start the text at the top line. You may use <code>\vfill</code>
(two l) as first line, to move everything down. Or you may use
<code>\vfil</code> (one l) at first and last line, to vertically center.</li>
<li>If the content of <code>copyrightpage</code> does not fit on one page,
it is an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very minimal copyright page might look like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{copyrightpage}<br>

<a id="dedicationpage"></a>
<h4>Environment: dedicationpage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{dedicationpage}</code> ... <code>\end{dedicationpage}</code></h5>
<p>Your book does not need a dedication. But if you use a dedication, it must
be the (recto) page that immediately follows the copyright page.</p>
<p>The <code>dedicationpage</code> environment is very basic. It centers text
horizontally, and slightly above vertically. The text is slightly larger than
normal size, and always in Italics. No header or footer is printed.</p>
<p>The text does not need <code>\par</code>. If the dedication is multi-line,
use the break <code>\\</code> as needed. Example:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{dedicationpage}<br>
For my friends\\and their dogs<br>
\end{dedicationpage}</code>
</div>
<p>For a more complex dedication, use the <code>fullpage</code> environment
instead, and format it yourself.</p>

<a id="contentspage"></a>
<h4>Environment: contentspage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{contentspage}</code> ... <code>\end{contentspage}</code></h5>
<p>For ordinary novels, a table of contents is unnecessary and discouraged.
Readers will not need it. But if your book is a collection of short stories,
then a table of contents may be useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing within <code>contentspage</code> is automated. The page title,
whether it be CONTENTS, or Table of Contents, or Table de Contenu, or
something else, is for you to provide. Use <code>\name</code>, or
<code>\subname</code>, or one of the <code>\formatX</code> commands, to
provide its style.</li>
<li>Use <code>\entry{chapter}{page}</code> as needed. This is not automated.
Do it yourself!</li>
<li>At the top of <code>contentspage</code> you may write
<code>\linegap{<i>N</i>}</code>, where N is a number &gt;=0 and &lt;=1.
This increases line-to-line spacing. It is useful if the table is short,
or it it is so long that it continues to a second page.</li>
<li>If page layout uses header, it will be empty. If page layout uses footer,
it will be empty. Some books put a page number on the contents page, but
Novelette does not.</li>
<li>Traditionally, you would not have a table of contents as the final
non-blank item in frontmatter. If you have nothing else to say, prior to
mainmatter, then you would insert a duplicate half-title recto page.
But with popular fiction, you may cheat. Instead of "CONTENTS" (or equivalent)
as the title of the table, use the title of your book.</li>
<li>You may place an image within <code>contentspage</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sample contents page:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{contentspage}<br>
\linegap{.25} % spread them<br>
\null\null % space at top<br>
\subname{CONTENTS} % or some other style<br>
\null<br>
\entry{1. The Widget}{1}<br>
\entry{2. Free Beer}{14}<br>
\entry{3. Too Good For You}{35}<br>
\entry{4. A Pleasant Surprise}{54}<br>
\entry{5. Aghast in Paris}{112}<br>
\entry{6. Beyond Belief}{187}<br>
\end{contentspage}
</code></div>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="upperpage"></a>
<h4>Environment: upperpage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{upperpage}</code> ... <code>\end{upperpage}</code></h5>
<p>The <code>upperpage</code> environment is used at the start of new
chapters. This may include some non-chapter material that is styled like
the first page of a chapter.</p>
<p>See the <a href="chapters.html">chapters page</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="blockindent"></a>
<h4>Environment: blockindent</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{blockindent}[<i>options</i>]</code> ... <code>\end{blockindent}</code></h5>
<p>This environment indents all of its content at left and/or right, relative
to main text. It is useful for poetry (verse), lengthy quotations, and
the like.</p>
<ul>
<li>The block may contain more than one paragraph.</li>
<li>If no option is provided, the block is indented 1 indent at left,
none at right.</li>
<li>If the option is an integer, such as <code>[3]</code>, then the block is
indented that many indents at left, none at right.</li>
<li>If the option is two comma-separated integers, such as <code>[3,2]</code>,
then they are applied at left and right, in that order.</li>
<li>Although you may use decimal numbers instead of integers, this is
discouraged, because it may look wrong. But if you wish to do something
such as set a block at exactly half the text width, with the block centered,
<code>[.25,.25]</code> does that.</li>
<li>The width of the block must be at least 0.4 of the full textwidth.</li>
<li>Within the block, paragraph indent is set to zero. If that is not what
you need, use <code>\forceindent</code> at the beginning of each paragraph
within the block.</li>
<li>Most style commands may be used within <code>blockindent</code>. But not
the other way around: If you use a style command (such as <code>\name</code>
or <code>\smalltext</code>, then you cannot use a block indent within
the style.</li>
<li>Do not place an <a href="images-icons#image"><code>\image</code></a>
within <code>blockindent</code>.</li>
<li>You may use the <code>center</code> environment inside
<code>blockindent</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="center"></a>
<h4>Environment: center</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{center}</code> ... <code>\end{center}</code></h5>
<p>Text within this environment is centered.</p>
<ul>
<li>The contents may contain more than one paragraph.</li>
<li>Most style commands may be used within <code>center</code>. However,
if there is a conflict (such as <code>\name</code> with its style
left-aligned) then results may not be what you expect.</li>
<li>If you do not wish the text to reach the full textwidth, you may place
<code>center</code> inside <code>blockindent</code>.</li>
<li>Do not place an <a href="images-icons.html#image"><code>\image</code></a>
within <code>center</code>.</li>
<li>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not insert additional
line space above or below <code>center</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<a id="aboutcopr" class="details"></a>
<h5 class="details">About Copyright Page</h5>
<p>Whether you use the <code>copyrightpage</code> environment, or design it
yourself within generic <code>fullpage</code>, it must be the page (verso)
that immediately follows the book title page.</p>
<p>The copyright page must contain this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title, subtitle (if any), author (possibly pseudonym). A widely-used
format is <code>The Title : The Subtitle / The Author</code>. It may appear on
more than one line.</li>
<li>Copyright statement. Minimal format: <i>Copyright ©2024 Your Name.
All Rights Reserved.</i> Some jurisdictions use lengthier statements.
Although it is not necessary to write both the word Copyright and the symbol,
it is more emphatic. Do not write <code>(c)</code>. Either paste the actual
copyright symbol from a character map, or use <code>\copyright</code>.</li>
<li>If the author name is a pseudonym, you should use your real name as
copyright holder, rather than the pseudonym. Reason: If someone violates your
copyright, and the copyright holder is "Some Fakename" (pseudonym), then
you will have to prove that "Some Fakename" is "Really You". But if the
copyright holder is "Really You" then there is one less obstacle.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances use "copyleft" or anything less than full copyright.
Many print-on-demand distributors refuse to carry books that have less than
full copyright.</li>
<li>Use a disclaimer. Typically they say <i>This is a work of fiction...</i>
and carry on from there. See other books in your genre for examples.</li>
<li>If you need to acknowledge use of a Trademark, quotation, or other
permitted use, you may do it here. This is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Provide the name of the publisher, and publisher's location. In the case
of self-published works, the publisher is <i>you</i>, not the distributor
or manufacturer. Most print-on-demand services will not allow you to
mention them.</li>
<li>For the publisher's location, The amount of required detail may vary with
jurisdiction. It may suffice to provide just your name and city/nation, since
other information can be obtained from the book distributor database.</li>
<li>Provide a means to contact the publisher (yourself). Commercial publishers
provide all of street addrress, telephone number, and web page URL. But for
a self-publisher without a business address, that much information (your home
address and phone) might be too much. Perhaps your own web page URL
is good enough. Some distributors provide an "author's page",
but in most cases you cannot list that URL here, because (a) the distributor
does not permit it, and (b) it is not a means to contact you, and (c) If you
change the distributor, then the URL is no longer valid.</li>
<li>Unless your book is printed in small quantity, for private use (not sold
via distribution), then it needs an ISBN. Show the ISBN in its standard
format. Do not show the barcode. Depending on jurisdiction, you may be able
to get a government-issued ISBN upon request, or the distributor may provide
an ISBN for free or small charge. Beware of procuring an ISBN from someone
else, because that number will be registered to whomever supplied it to you,
rather than to the distributor or yourself.</li>
<li>If your book has library catalog data (unlikely), provide it in the
standard format. Nowadays, popular fiction rarely has catalog data, because
libraries list popular fiction by genre (crime, romance, sci-fi, etc.) and
author surname, not by catalog number. You may see
"Publisher's Cataloging-in-Publication Data available upon request."
The publisher may not really have it, and nobody may request it.</li>
<li>Many jurisdictions require that the name and location of printer be
shown, in a particular location. This is known as Impressum. But with
print-on-demand, you do not know where any particular copy will be printed,
or who will print it. The required information will probably be added by the
printer at time of printing, on the final verso page. If in doubt, ask the
distributor.</li>

<h5 class="details">About Dedications</h5>
<p>If you use a dedication, it must be located on the (recto) page that
immediately follows the (verso) copyright page.</p>
<p>There is no need for a dedication. It is a custom
that began when poor authors dedicated books to rich folks, in hopes of
getting some benefit from the mention. It evolved into a quick way to
thank or commemorate someone.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can do that on a web site. which can easily be edited.
Visualize your wife Zelda browsing through your bookshelf, only to find
old books dedicated to her sister, Wanda.</p>
<p>Beware: Do not dedicate the book to someone who may resent the mention.</p>
<p>However, all books need something between the copyright page and the start
of the story, so that the page spread does not have legalese at left, story
at right. A dedication page (with blank verso) is one way to do this.</p>
<p>In English, a dedication does not begin with "Dedicated to" or anything
similar. Typically, it starts with "For..." or "To..." or something else.</p>
<p>If you wish to give a lengthy shout-out to those who provided information
and assistance, use <code>fullpage</code> to create an Acknowledgements page.
It may be placed in frontmatter, or backmatter.</p>
