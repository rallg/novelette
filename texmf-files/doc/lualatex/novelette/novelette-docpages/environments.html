<a href="intro"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>An <i>environment</i> starts with <code>\begin{<i>something</i>}</code>
and ends with <code>\end{<i>something</i>}</code>. The <code>\begin</code>
tells the compiler to use certain settings, which will be applied until
<code>\end</code>.</p>
<p>Use only the environments described on this page. LaTeX has many built-in
environments, most of which are only relevant to math or academic works.
Novelette disallows them. If you attempt to use a disallowed environment,
then an error may result.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="document"></a>
<h4>Environment: document</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{document}</code> ... <code>\end{document}</code></h5>
<p>This environment is required. Its contents are the "document body" which
will print.<p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Preamble</i> precedes <code>\begin{document}</code>.</li>
<li>Anything written after <code>\end{document}</code> is ignored. You may
write notes to yourself there, if you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="fullpage"></a>
<h4>Environment: fullpage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{fullpage}</code> ... <code>\end{fullpage}</code></h5>
<p>The <code>fullpage</code> environment begins a new page. When it ends,
the following material begin on a new page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not confuse this environment with a full-page floated image.</li>
<li>The <code>fullpage</code> is intended for just one page. However, if there
is too much inside, it continues to a second page, also <code>fullpage</code>.
An alert is issued.</li>
<li>A <code>fullpage</code> does not print header or footer. You may locally
over-ride using <a href="misc.html#tps"><code>\thispagestyle</code></a>.</li>
<li>You may use ordinary text, <code>\image</code>, <code>\icon</code>, and the
styling commands <code>\name \subname \format \smalltext</code> inside
<code>fullpage</code>.</li>
<li>You may not use <code>\footnote</code>. But you may use <code>\vfill</code>
to spread whatever is above it, from whatever is below it.</li>
<li>You may nest an <code>upperpage</code> environment at the top of
<code>fullpage</code>.</li>
<li>You may nest the <code>center</code> and <code>blockindent</code>
environments within <code>fullpage</code>.</li>
<li>If you place an <a href="images-icons#image"><code>\image</code></a>
in <code>fullpage</code>, it cannot float, but must appear where you write
the command.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="legal"></a>
<h4>Environment: legal</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{legal}</code> ... <code>\end{legal}</code></h5>
<p>Like <code>fullpage</code>, the <code>legal</code> environment begins and
ends with a new page, and does not print header or footer. But unlike
<code>fullpage</code>, the <code>legal</code> environment restricts what you
can do inside it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>legal</code> environment is designed for use as the
copyright page.</li>
<li>You do not need to use this environment, if you prefer to style the
copyright page yourself. But <code>legal</code> is recommended, because it
pre-styles its content, and thus involves less coding on your part.</li>
<li>You cannot nest <code>legal</code> within <code>fullpage</code>, because
<code>legal</code> already has its own <code>fullpage</code> wrapper.</li>
<li>Within <code>legal</code> :
<ul>
<li>Text is horizontally and vertically centered.</li>
<li>Hyphenation is disabled.</li>
<li>Numbers are lining, not oldstyle.</li>
<li>No indentation.</li>
<li>Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.</li>
<li>You may not use <code>\image</code>, but you may
use <code>\icon</code>.</li>
<li>Commands <code>\name \subname \format</code> are disabled.</li>
<li>You may not nest another environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="upperpage"></a>
<h4>Environment: upperpage</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{upperpage}</code> ... <code>\end{upperpage}</code></h5>
<p>The <code>upperpage</code> environment is used at the start of new
chapters. This may include some non-chapter material that is styled like
the first page of a chapter.</p>
<p>See the <a href="chapters.html">chapters page</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="blockindent"></a>
<h4>Environment: blockindent</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{blockindent}[<i>options</i>]</code>
... <code>\end{blockindent}</code></h5>
<p>This environment indents all of its content at left and/or right, relative
to main text. It is useful for poetry (verse), lengthy quotations, and
the like. It is also useful for narrowing the textwidth, so that the
included text occupies several part-width lines, instead of one or two
full-width lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>The block may contain more than one paragraph.</li>
<li>If no option is provided, the block is indented 1 indent at left,
none at right.</li>
<li>If the option is an integer, such as <code>[3]</code>, then the block is
indented that many indents at left, none at right.</li>
<li>If the option is two comma-separated integers, such as <code>[3,2]</code>,
then they are applied at left and right, in that order.</li>
<li>Although you may use decimal numbers instead of integers, this is
discouraged, because it may look wrong. But if you wish to do something
such as set a block at exactly half the text width, with the block centered,
<code>[.25,.25]</code> does that.</li>
<li>The width of the block must be at least 0.4 of the full textwidth.</li>
<li>Within the block, paragraph indent is set to zero. If that is not what
you need, use <code>\forceindent</code> at the beginning of each paragraph
within the block.</li>
<li>If the <code>blockindent</code> sits within a <code>fullpage</code> or
<code>upperpage</code> environment, then style commands
<code>\name \subname \format \smalltext</code> may be placed within the
<code>blockindent</code>. But if the <code>blockindent</code> does not
sit within those environments, they style commands may not be used.</li>
<li>You may <i>not</i> place a <code>blockindent</code> within any of the above
style commands.</li>
<li>You may <i>not</i> use <a href="images-icons#image"><code>\image</code></a>
within <code>blockindent</code>. You may use
<a href="images-icons#icon">\icon</a>.</li>
<li>You may use the <code>center</code> environment inside
<code>blockindent</code>, but not the other way around: You cannot use
<code>blockindent</code> within <code>center</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="center"></a>
<h4>Environment: center</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{center}</code> ... <code>\end{center}</code></h5>
<p>Everything within this environment is centered.</p>
<ul>
<li>The contents may contain more than one paragraph.</li>
<li>When <code>center</code> sits within <code>fullpage</code> or
<code>\upperpage</code>, you may use style commands.</li>
<li>If a style command, or image, uses <code>[align=<i>setting</i>]</code>,
the setting will be ignored.</li>
<li>If you do not wish the text to reach the full textwidth, you may place
<code>center</code> inside <code>blockindent</code>.</li>
<li>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not insert additional
line space above or below <code>center</code>.</li>
<li>You may not place <code>blockindent</code> inside <code>center</code>.</li>
<li>You may place <code>center</code> between paragraphs of main text.</p>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="nosuch"></a>
<h4>No Others!</h4>
<p>LaTeX provides many other built-in environments. However, you cannot use
them in Novelette. Among them are list, table, flushright, equation, etc.</p>
<p>Novelette attempts to intercept requests for the prohibited environments.
An error or alert is issued. But this is not foolproof.</p>
<p>You have been warned!</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<a id="aboutcopr" class="details"></a>
<h5 class="details">About Copyright Page</h5>
<p>A very minimal copyright page might look like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{legal}<br>
\vfil<br></code>
My Wonderful Story :<code>\\</code><br>
An Awesome Tale<code>\\</code><br>
/ Tony Baloney<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Copyright ©2024 Tommy Salami. All Rights Reserved.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is a work of fiction. All characters and events are from the author's
imagination. Locations are used fictionally.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Published by the copyright holder, CityName NationName.<br>
Online http://www.example.com/baloneytales<br>
&nbsp;<br>
ISBN 0-00000-0000-00-0<br>
<code>\vfil<br>
\end{legal}
</code></div>
<p>Whether you use the <code>legal</code> environment, or create your own
design within <code>fullpage</code>, it must be the page (verso)
that immediately follows the book title page.</p>
<p>The copyright page must contain this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title, subtitle (if any), author (possibly pseudonym). A widely-used
format is <code>The Title : The Subtitle / The Author</code>. It may appear on
more than one line.</li>
<li>Copyright statement. Minimal format: <i>Copyright ©2024 Your Name.
All Rights Reserved.</i> Some jurisdictions use lengthier statements.
Although it is not necessary to write both the word Copyright and the symbol,
it is more emphatic. Do not write <code>(c)</code>. Either paste the actual
copyright symbol from a character map, or use <code>\copyright</code>.</li>
<li>If the author name is a pseudonym, you should use your real name as
copyright holder, rather than the pseudonym. Reason: If someone violates your
copyright, and the copyright holder is "Some Fakename" (pseudonym), then
you will have to prove that "Some Fakename" is "Really You". But if the
copyright holder is "Really You" then there is one less obstacle.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances use "copyleft" or anything less than full copyright.
Many print-on-demand distributors refuse to carry books that have less than
full copyright.</li>
<li>Use a disclaimer. Typically they say <i>This is a work of fiction...</i>
and carry on from there. See other books in your genre for examples.</li>
<li>If you need to acknowledge use of a Trademark, quotation, or other
permitted use, you may do it here. This is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Provide the name of the publisher, and publisher's location. In the case
of self-published works, the publisher is <i>you</i>, not the distributor
or manufacturer. Most print-on-demand services will not allow you to
mention them.</li>
<li>For the publisher's location, The amount of required detail may vary with
jurisdiction. It may suffice to provide just your name and city/nation, since
other information can be obtained from the book distributor database.</li>
<li>Provide a means to contact the publisher (yourself). Commercial publishers
provide all of street addrress, telephone number, and web page URL. But for
a self-publisher without a business address, that much information (your home
address and phone) might be too much. Perhaps your own web page URL
is good enough. Some distributors provide an "author's page",
but in most cases you cannot list that URL here, because (a) the distributor
does not permit it, and (b) it is not a means to contact you, and (c) If you
change the distributor, then the URL is no longer valid.</li>
<li>Unless your book is printed in small quantity, for private use (not sold
via distribution), then it needs an ISBN. Show the ISBN in its standard
format. Do not show the barcode. Depending on jurisdiction, you may be able
to get a government-issued ISBN upon request, or the distributor may provide
an ISBN for free or small charge. Beware of procuring an ISBN from someone
else, because that number will be registered to whomever supplied it to you,
rather than to the distributor or yourself.</li>
<li>If your book has library catalog data (unlikely), provide it in the
standard format. Nowadays, popular fiction rarely has catalog data, because
libraries list popular fiction by genre (crime, romance, sci-fi, etc.) and
author surname, not by catalog number. You may see
"Publisher's Cataloging-in-Publication Data available upon request."
The publisher may not really have it, and nobody may request it.</li>
<li>Many jurisdictions require that the name and location of printer be
shown, in a particular location. This is known as Impressum. But with
print-on-demand, you do not know where any particular copy will be printed,
or who will print it. The required information will probably be added by the
printer at time of printing, on the final verso page. If in doubt, ask the
distributor.</li>
