<h2 class="title">Copyright Page</h2>

<p>This page is under development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Copyright Page is the verso of the Title Page. It must be located in
frontmatter. This page is "legalese" that descibes your book as an object
of commerce, and library cataloging (if applicable).</p>
<p>The Copyright Page is unlike any other page in your book. It does not
feature anything decorative. Certain text effects, such as curly quotes,
are not used. Nothing is hyphenated. Lines are not justified. Text does not
start at the top line of the page.</p>
<p>For your convenience, Novelette provides the <code>copyrightpage</code>
environment. You do not have to use it, if you know how to do whatever
needs to be done. But it is a very good idea to use this environment,
since it does the thinking for you.</p>
<p>Commands:
<code>\begin{copyrightpage}[options] ... \end{copyrightpage}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The copyrightpage environment begins a new page, and ends the page.</li>
<li>The page will have empty header and footer.</li>
<li>These commands are disabled: \name, \subname, \stylea, \styleb, \stylec.
If you use them, ordinary text prints. You cannot use an opening.</li>
<li>If you attempt to use curly quotes or curly apostrophes, they will be
converted to the straight forms. Multiple hyphens will be converted to
endash or emdash, as usual.</li>
<li>Guillemets may be used. French punctuation will be honored.</li>
<li>The text will be Swainson. You may use the altfont, but it should not
be necessary.</li>
<li>No words will be hyphenated, unless you manually type a hyphen.
But lines will not break at a typed hyphen.</li>
<li>Ligatures are prohibited.</li>
<li>Text is not justified. It will appear with ragged right margin.
Or, you may request centered text.</li>
<li>Paragraphs are not indented. There is a one-line gap
between paragraphs.</li>
<li>Best appearance will be when you break lines manually, instead of
letting them wrap.</li>
<li>Numerals will be lining, regardless of the style used for main text.</li>
<li>You may use Italics and small caps.</li>
<li>If the <code>[option]</code> contains the word <code>center</code> then
text is centered, instead of aligned at left. If the option contains
<code>side=I</code> where I is a small integer, then the block of text will be
indented that many normal indents, both left and right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use (c) to mean copyright. Either paste the actual symbol from
a character map, or use <code>\copyright</code> code.</p>
<p>The copyright page must contain this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title, subtitle (if any), author (possibly pseudonym). A widely-used
format is <i>The Title : The Subtitle / The Author</i>. It may appear on
more than one line.</li> 
<li>Copyright statement. Minimal format: <i>Copyright ©2023 Your Name.
All Rights Reserved.</i> Although it is not necessary to write both the
word Copyright and the symbol, it is more emphatic. Although <i>Your Name</i>
my be a pseudonym (in some jurisdictions, not all), you should use your true
name, even if the author is a pseudonym. Without your true name, you will
have a harder time enforcing copyright infringement. You would need
to prove that author <i>Fake Name</i> is in fact <i>Really You</i>.</li>
<li>You may wish to write additional warnings and imprecations against
copying. See other books in your genre, for examples. Under no circumstances
use "copyleft" or anything less than full copyright. Many print services
will refuse to carry books that have less than full copyright.</li>
<li>Use a disclaimer. Typically they say <i>This is a work of fiction...</i>
and carry on from there. See other books in your genre for examples.</li>
<li>If you need to acknowledge use of a Trademark, quotation, or other
permitted use, you may do it here. This is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Provide the name of the publisher (that may be yourself, but it is
certainly not the print-on-demand service) and location. The amount of detail
may vary with jurisdiction. It may suffice to provide just the name and city,
since other information can be obtained from the book distributor database.
Or you may need to provide a full address or other information.</li>
<li>Provide a means to contact the publisher (yourself). A web page URL
is probably good enough.</li>
<li>Unless your book is printed in small quantity, for private use (not sold
via distribution), then it needs an ISBN. Show the ISBN in its standard
format. Do not show the barcode.</li>
<li>If your book has library catalog data (unlikely), provide it in the
standard format. Nowadays, popular fiction rarely has catalog data, because
libraries list popular fiction by genre (crime, romance, sci-fi, etc.) and
author surname, not by catalog number. You may see
"Publisher's Catalog-in-Publication Data available upon request."
The publisher may not really have it, and nobody may request it.</li>
<li>Many jurisdictions require that the name and location of printer be
shown, in a particular location. But with print-on-demand, you do not know
where any particular copy will be printed, or who will print it. The required
information will probably be added by the printer at time of printing,
on the final verso page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above sound like a lot of information, but it is not. For many books,
the copyright page will read like this:</p>
