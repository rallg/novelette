<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>The <i>Copyright Page</i> is the verso of the Title Page. It must be located in
frontmatter. This page is "legalese" that descibes your book as an object
of commerce, and library cataloging (if applicable).</p>
<p>The Copyright Page is unlike any other page in your book. It does not
feature anything decorative. Certain text effects, such as curly quotes,
are not used. Nothing is hyphenated. Lines are not justified. Text does not
start at the top line of the page.</p>
<p>For your convenience, Novelette provides the
<a href="fullpage.html"><code>copyrightpage</code></a> environment.
You do not have to use it, if you know how to do whatever
needs to be done. But it is a very good idea to use this environment,
since it does the thinking for you. See the example, lower on this page.</p>


<a id="general"></a>
<h4>General Information</h4>
<p>Do not use <code>(c)</code> to mean copyright. Either paste the actual
symbol from a character map, or use <code>\copyright</code> code.</p>
<p>The copyright page must contain this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title, subtitle (if any), author (possibly pseudonym). A widely-used
format is <code>The Title : The Subtitle / The Author</code>. It may appear on
more than one line.</li>
<li>Copyright statement. Minimal format: <i>Copyright ©2024 Your Name.
All Rights Reserved.</i> Although it is not necessary to write both the
word Copyright and the symbol, it is more emphatic.</li>
<li>If the author name is a pseudonym, you should use your real name as
copyright holder, rather than the pseudonym. If someone violates your
copyright, and the copyright holder is "Some Fakename" (pseudonym), then
you will have to prove that "Some Fakename" is "Really You". But if the
copyright holder is "Really You" then there is one less obstacle.</li>
<li>You may wish to write additional warnings and imprecations against
copying. See other books in your genre, for examples. Under no circumstances
use "copyleft" or anything less than full copyright. Many print-on-demand
distributors refuse to carry books that have less than full copyright.</li>
<li>Use a disclaimer. Typically they say <i>This is a work of fiction...</i>
and carry on from there. See other books in your genre for examples.</li>
<li>If you need to acknowledge use of a Trademark, quotation, or other
permitted use, you may do it here. This is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Provide the name of the publisher, and publisher's location. The amount of
detail may vary with jurisdiction. It may suffice to provide just the name
and city, since other information can be obtained from the book distributor
database. Or you may need to provide a full address or other information.
In any case, the publisher is <i>not</i> the print-on-demand distributor or
manufacturer. In most cases, the publisher is <i>you</i>.</li>
<li>Provide a means to contact the publisher (yourself). A web page URL
is probably good enough. Some distributors provide an "author's page",
but in most cases you cannot list that URL here, because (a) the distributor
does not permit it, and (b) it is not a means to contact you.</li>
<li>Unless your book is printed in small quantity, for private use (not sold
via distribution), then it needs an ISBN. Show the ISBN in its standard
format. Do not show the barcode. Depending on jurisdiction, you may be able
to get a government-issued ISBN upon request, or the distributor may provide
an ISBN for free or small charge. Beware of procuring an ISBN from someone
else, because that number will be registered to whomever supplied it to you,
rather than to the distributor or yourself.</li>
<li>If your book has library catalog data (unlikely), provide it in the
standard format. Nowadays, popular fiction rarely has catalog data, because
libraries list popular fiction by genre (crime, romance, sci-fi, etc.) and
author surname, not by catalog number. You may see
"Publisher's Cataloging-in-Publication Data available upon request."
The publisher may not really have it, and nobody may request it.</li>
<li>Many jurisdictions require that the name and location of printer be
shown, in a particular location. This is known as Impressum. But with
print-on-demand, you do not know where any particular copy will be printed,
or who will print it. The required information will probably be added by the
printer at time of printing, on the final verso page. If in doubt, ask the
distributor.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sample Code for Copyright Page</h4>
<p>The above sounds like a lot of information, but it is not. For many books,
the copyright page will look like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>

&nbsp;<br>
Copyright ©2023 Tommy Salami. All Rights Reserved.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

imagination. Locations are used fictionally.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
