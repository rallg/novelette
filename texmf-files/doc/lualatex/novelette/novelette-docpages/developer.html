<p>You do not need to know any of this. Your best strategy is to ignore this
page, and write your book.</p>
<p>But if you already know some LaTeX, or are learning it via other online
resources, you may wonder why "the Novelette way" is very different from
"the standard LaTeX way."</p>
<p>Each of the RETURN links leads to some other page, where the topic is
mentioned.</p>

<h4>Why no bold, underline, strikeout ?</h4>
<p>With the possible exception of bold titles, there is no need for any of
bold, underline, or strikeout in popular fiction. If you code one of the
standard LaTeX commands for any of these, your code will be silently ignored.
The less you think about text style changes, the more you will write your
story.</p>
<p>Novelette disables these commands by re-defining them, so that they have
no effect. However, bold text is allowed in openings and displays.</p>

</p>


<h4>Why no size commands, such as \small and \large ?</h4>
<p>Popular fiction has no need of text sizing, except in openings and displays.
The well-known size commands are re-defined, so that they silently do nothing.

</p>


<h4>Why no tables or lists ?</h4>
<p>It is difficult to create tables that follow the same positioning rules
as main text. Since tables and lists is almost never needed in popular fiction,
the related commands are disabled.</p>
<p>If you do need a table, create it in a different document class, then
convert the PDF to a *.png raster image at 600 pixels/inch, trimmed to
the correct size. Since Novelette is for print to paper (not Ebook, you do not
need scalable graphics.</p>
<p>If you need a list, you may manually create it. Most fonts (including
Swainson) have solid and open bullet characters. You probably should use
block indents, to arrange the list items.</p>

</p>


<h4>Why no vector graphics, such as PDF images, EPS, TiKz ?</h4>
<p>You may surprised to know that some print-on-demand services will reject
PDF files containing vector graphic drawings. This is because the manufacturing
process is high-speed. Your PDF is only allowed to consume a certain amount
of processing time. But vector graphics may require more time to process.</p>
<p>Also, even if a vector drawing has correct syntax, it may contain paths
and elements that can be interpreted in more than one way. Your book may be
sent to several manufacturers, possibly using different software to interpret
your PDF. You have no control over this. So, anything that could possibly
be mis-understood, is cause for rejection.</p>
<p>But ordinary text consists of many small vector glyphs, so why is there
no problem? Due to the relative simplicity of glyph outlines (not counting the
svg fonts intended for Internet), font creation programs can validate each
glyph. All good fonts (Including Swainson/Towhee) have been validated.</p>

<h4>Can Novelette be used for hardcover books ?</h4>
<p>Novelette does not know, or care, how your book is manufactured. The
documentation always mentions "Perfect Print" softcover, because nowadays,
virtually all print-on-demand books use it.</p>
<p>There was a time, not that long ago,
when many public libraries (the kind that stock popular fiction) would not
purchase softcover, due to concerns about durability. But the manufacturing
technology has improved to the point where this is less of a concern.
Softcover is much cheaper than hardcover. A mangled book can be more easily
replaced. Also, most popular fiction has a limited time before potential
readers lose interest, and the books goes out to the recycler.
In other words, avoid hardcover, unless you are certain that you need it.</p>
<p>If you do wish to have hardcover: The binding used for library books
is generally known as "Smythe Sewn". It opens flat. Pages are "sewn in
signatures" rather than glued. This is the kind of hardcover used for
popular fiction (and non-fiction). Some "cloth cover" books use this
binding.</p>
<p>But that is not the only kind of hardcover.
In the case of some legal and technical works (patents, trusts, etc.)
the pages are both glued and sewn, in a way that makes it nearly impossible
to add or remove pages without detection. This kind of hardcover is intended
for evidence and archiving, not reading. The book will not open flat.
If a business offers to convert
a softcover into hardcover, this is probably what they will do (and you will
not like the result). Be sure to ask.</p>

<h4>Why does Novelette insist on very short frontmatter ?</h4>
<p>Novelette (as software) does not care, but print services (as manufacturers)
do care.</p>
<p>Most print-on-demand services require that the book title and author be
identical, wherever they appear. Certainly they appear on the cover, title
page, half-title, and copyright pages. But what about running page headers?</p>
<p>Popular fiction (and non-fiction) usually has the book title, and author
name, in running page headers. Places such as chapter openings omit the
header. The most essential frontammter pages omit the header. No problem.</p>
<p>But according to rules found in manuals of style, any extended frontmatter
section (such as lengthy Introduction) does not have the book title or author
in page headers. Instead, the header may simply say "Introduction", both
verso and recto. In the case of classical literature, which may have a
Preface written by some critic other than the book's author, The Preface may
use "Preface" and "Critic's Name" in headings. All of this violates the
rules for print-on-demand. So you have a choice: If you violate the rules
for print-on-demand, your book may be rejected or mis-printed (because the
factory will think that the different headers are for different books).
If you obey the rules for print-on-demand, then you violate the manuals
of style (it has happened).</p>
<p>If you have something to say about the story, then avoid telling it
in frontmatter. Instead, put it on an author's web page. This also allows
you the change what you say, according to circumstances.</p>
