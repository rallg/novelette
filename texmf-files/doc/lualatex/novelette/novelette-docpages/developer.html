<p>This page is for the benefit of future package maintainers. If you are
simply using Novelette to write a book, then you do not need to know any
of this.</p>

<h4>Why compile with lualatex ?</h4>
<p>LuaLaTeX is LaTeX with built-in Lua programming language. Using Lua does not
require "shell escape" or special permissions, to do some tasks that otherwise
could not be done by LaTeX alone.</p>
<p>In particular, Lua allows byte inspection of image files, look-ahead and
look-back parsing of documents, and other control. Some of this is used
in macros (written by others) that allow Novelette to behave just a little bit
more like design software. It is essential for PDF/X with images.</p>


<h4>Why no bold, underline, strikeout, small, large ?</h4>
<p>Most LaTeX text styles are silently disabled. Popular fiction
has no need of them, and (in many cases) use of the LaTeX style commands
may throw text off-grid, or otherwise cause alignment problems.</p>

<h4>Why no tables or lists ?</h4>
<p>It is difficult to create tables that follow the same positioning rules as
main text, and appear exactly where you want them to appear. This is because
LaTeX was created for academic works, which use different presentation.</p>
<p>Since tables and lists are almost never needed in popular fiction,
the related commands are disabled (with error).</p>
<p>It is always possible to write lists manually, using block indent, bullets,
and other ordinary text methods.</p>
<p>A table can be created using a different document class, with the result
converted to raster png, then placed in Novelette as an image. Since print
is only to paper, the loss of scalable graphics does not matter.</p>

<h4>Why no vector graphics, such as PDF images, EPS, TiKz ?</h4>
<p>You may surprised to know that some print-on-demand services will reject
PDF files containing vector graphic drawings. This is because the manufacturing
process is high-speed. Your PDF is only allowed to consume a certain amount
of processing time. But vector graphics may require more time to process.</p>
<p>Also, even if a vector drawing has correct syntax, it may contain paths
and elements that can be interpreted in more than one way. Your book may be
sent to several manufacturers, possibly using different software to interpret
your PDF. You have no control over this. So, anything that could possibly
be mis-understood, is cause for rejection.</p>
<p>But ordinary text consists of many small vector glyphs, so why is there
no problem? Due to the relative simplicity of glyph outlines (not counting the
svg fonts intended for Internet), font creation programs can validate each
glyph. All good fonts (Including Swainson/Towhee) have been validated.</p>
<p>Some decorative fonts have characters traced from drawings. These are
likely to be invalid, and may cause printing problems (even if they look
good in the PDF). Better to rasterize them.</p>

<h4>Can Novelette be used for hardcover books ?</h4>
<p>Novelette does not know, or care, how your book is manufactured. The
documentation assumes "Perfect Print" softcover, because nowadays,
virtually all print-on-demand books use it.</p>
<p>There was a time, not that long ago,
when many public libraries (the kind that stock popular fiction) would not
purchase softcover, due to concerns about durability. But the manufacturing
technology has improved to the point where this is less of a concern.
Softcover is much cheaper than hardcover. A mangled book can be more easily
replaced. Also, most popular fiction has a limited time before potential
readers lose interest, and the books go out to the recycler.</p>
<p>The binding used for hadcover library books
is generally known as "Smythe Sewn". It opens flat. Pages are "sewn in
signatures" rather than glued. Some "cloth cover" books use this binding.</p>
<p>But that is not the only kind of hardcover.
In the case of some legal and technical works (patents, trusts, etc.)
the pages are both glued and sewn, in a way that makes it nearly impossible
to add or remove pages without detection. This kind of hardcover is intended
for evidence and archiving, not reading. The book will not open flat.</p>

<h4>Why does Novelette recommend very short frontmatter ?</h4>
<p>Novelette (as software) does not care, but print services (as manufacturers)
do care.</p>
<p>Most print-on-demand services require that the book title and author be
identical, wherever they appear. Certainly they appear on the cover, title
page, half-title, and copyright pages. But what about running page headers?</p>
<p>Popular fiction (and non-fiction) usually has the book title, and author
name, in running page headers. Places such as chapter openings omit the
header. The most essential frontmatter pages omit the header. No problem.</p>
<p>But according to rules found in manuals of style, any extended frontmatter
section (such as lengthy Preface) does not have the book title or author
in page headers. Instead, the header may simply say "Preface", both
verso and recto. In the case of classical literature, which may have a
Preface written by some critic other than the book's author, The Preface may
use the critic's name (instead of the book author's name) in headings.
All of this violates the rules for print-on-demand. So you have a choice:
If you violate the rules for print-on-demand, your book may be rejected or
mis-printed (because the factory will think that the different headers are
for different books). If you obey the rules for print-on-demand,
then you violate the manuals of style.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that popular fiction will need extended frontmatter.
If the author has something to say about the book, that information can be
put on a web page. Also, web pages are easily changed. If the book eventually
becomes so famous that it becomes canonical literature with critical editions,
then there is no need for Novelette.</p>
