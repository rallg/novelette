<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>The <i>document body</i> is everything between
(but not including) <code>\begin{document}</code> and
<code>\end{document}</code>. This is where you write your book.<p>
<p>If you write anything following <code>\end{document}</code>, it will be
ignored. So, if you need to write a note to yourself, you can put it there.</p>

<h4>Code Example<br>
<code>\frontmatter</code> ... <code>\mainmatter</code> ... <code>\backmatter</code></h4>
<div class="codeblock">
% Preamble is up here.<br>
<code>\begin{document}</code><br>
<code>\frontmatter</code><br>
<i>Content of frontmatter</i><br>
<code>\mainmatter</code><br>
<i>Content of mainmatter.</i><br>
<code>\backmatter</code> % Rarely used.<br>
<i>Content of backmatter, if any.</i><br>
<code>\end{document}</code><br>
<i>Anything written here will be ignored.</i>

<a id="subdocs"></a>
<h4>Using Subdocs</h4>
<p>Best practice is to divide your book into a number of component files,
each of which can be edited independently. Then you can compile just one
portion at a time, as you write and edit.</p>
<p>Although LaTeX has several ways to do that, Novelette does it one way:
using <i>subdocs</i>. You will be so happy! The use of subdocs is described
<a href="subdocs.html">on another page</a>.</p>

<a id="whatfront"></a>
<h4>What is Frontmatter?</h4>
<p>Front Matter, or <i>frontmatter</i> is a standard publishing term. It refers
to the material that precedes the start of your story.</p>
<p>Novelette expects that the frontmatter will be <i>exactly six pages</i>,
with very specific construction. 
This is explained in detail <a href="frontmatter.html">on another page</a>.</p>

<a id="whatmain"></a>
<h4>What is Main Matter?</h4>
<p>Main Matter, or <i>mainmatter</i>, is your story. It includes all chapters,
and possibly things such as Prologue, Epilogue, and anything else that
is part of the story. If there is a fictional Introduction (perhaps pretending
to be written by an archaeologist, who discovered the rest of the story in a
lost manuscript), then it is also mainmatter.</p>
<p>Mainmatter re-sets printable page numbering to arabic 1. If the layout has header
or footer, it will print, except header will not print above chapter openings.
Note: Internal PDF page numbering is not re-set.</p>
<p>If possible, write your story so that it ends mid-way on a recto page.
This presents the most pleasing appearance, especially if you have
something in backmatter.</p>

<a id="whatback"></a>
<h4>What is Back Matter?</h4>
<p>Back Matter, or <i>backmatter</i> is material added after the story ends.
It is common in academic non-fiction, where there may be a bibliography,
endnotes, appendix, index. But in the case of popular fiction, it is very rare
to use backmatter.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may place a very short "About the Author" in backmatter.
If you have Acknowledgements, you may put them here. Commercially
published books may show movie posters, advertisements (no joke!) or other
irrelevant material. Don't do that.</p>
<p>If you use backmatter, it does not reset the page numbering,  but no page
numbers or header/footer will print.</p>

<a id="lastpage"></a>
<h4>The Final Page</h4>
<p>No matter how your book ends (with or without backmatter), Novelette
will automatically add one or two blank pages, so that the final page of
the PDF is blank verso. This is required by print-on-demand. In some cases,
the manufacturer will add more blank pages.</p>
<p>The final verso page (blank in your PDF) may have a manufacturer code
added, at time of printing. This is not within your control.</p>
