<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>The <i>document body</i> is everything between
(but not including) <code>\begin{document}</code> and
<code>\end{document}</code>. This is where you write your book.<p>
<p>If you write anything following <code>\end{document}</code>, it will be
ignored. So, if you need to write a note to yourself, you can put it there.</p>


<a id="thecode"></a>
<h4>Code Example<br>
<code>\frontmatter</code> ... <code>\mainmatter</code> ... <code>\backmatter</code></h4>
<div class="codeblock">
% Preamble is up here.<br>
<code>\begin{document}</code><br>
<code>\frontmatter</code><br>
<i>Content of frontmatter</i><br>
<code>\mainmatter</code><br>
<i>Content of mainmatter.</i><br>
<code>\backmatter</code> % Rarely used.<br>
<i>Content of backmatter, if any.</i><br>
<code>\end{document}</code><br>
<i>Anything written here will be ignored.</i>
</div>

<a id="subfiles"></a>
<h4>Using Subfiles</h4>
<p>Best practice is to divide your book into a number of component files,
each of which can be edited independently. Then you can compile just one
portion at a time, as you write and edit.</p>
<p>Although LaTeX has several ways to do that, Novelette does it one way:
using <i>subfiles</i>. You will be so happy! The use of subfiles is described
<a href="subfiles.html">on another page</a>.</p>

<a id="whatfront"></a>
<h4>What is Frontmatter?</h4>
<p>Front Matter, or <i>frontmatter</i> is a standard publishing term. It refers
to the material that precedes the start of your story.</p>
<p>Novelette expects that the frontmatter will be <i>exactly six pages</i>.
If you do something else, then it is your responsibility to ensure correct
page styles; Novelette will not flag erroneous content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Page i : Half-Title. This shows only the book title (not subtitle or
author). Its text size is usually larger than normal, but smaller than the
title that appears on the Title Page. You may use an image for the half-title
text.</li>
<li>Page ii : Frontispiece. This page is normally blank. If you have an
interesting illustration, you may put it here.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a good place for a map, as long as the main story does
not direct the reader to look for the map in a particular location.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Commercially published books may show a list of books by the same
author (or a movie advertisement!), but print-on-demand discourages that.</li>
<li>Page iii : Title Page. This show the title, subtitle (if any), author,
and possibly a publisher identification. It should be as artistic as you
can manage, possibly using images.</li>
<li>Page iv : Copyright Page. This all-important page shows the title,
subtitle, author, copyright holder, publisher information, ISBN,  disclaimer,
and other items of a "legalese" naure. It is described in more detail
<a href="copyrightpage.html">on another page</a>.</li>
<li>Page v : Visual Separator. This page faces the copyright page. When readers
open your book, you do not want them to see copyright legalese at left,
fictional story at right. So you provide something that separates them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If your book uses a Dedication, it goes here (nowhere else).
Without a Dedication, you could put a short Author's Note, or short
Acknowledgements, or an Epigraph, or table of contents (if the book is a
collection of short stories), or simply repeat the half-title. But this is not
the place to annoy your readers with personal information that detracts from
the story.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you want both a Dedication and short table of contents,
without adding more pages here, you may cheat: Intead of naming the page
"Contents", place the Dedication first, then a gap, then follow with the
untitled table of contents beneath it. This is non-standard style,
but it works.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You may also cheat with a Dedication above an Epigraph, as long
as they do not conflict. But do not place a Dedication above something
such as Author's Note or Acknowledgements; you can put those in backmatter,
if necessary.</li> 
<li>Page vi : Final page of frontmatter, usually blank. This page faces the
start of your story. In most cases, it should be blank, so as not to detract
from the mood.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In rare cases, you may put something that leads into the story,
such as a map of the room where the body as found (for an English murder
mystery in a rural mansion) because readers expect it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frontmatter does not print headers or footers (so no page numbers appear).
The PDF has internal page numbers i-vi. If you are a purist who prefers
uppercase Roman, write <code>\myroman{R}</code> in Preamble.</p>
<p>If you do not use the <code>\frontmatter</code> command, then do not
use <code>\mainmatter</code> either. The only reason you might do this, is if
you are mis-using Novelette for something other than a book. Naughty!</p>

<a id="whatmain"></a>
<h4>What is Main Matter?</h4>
<p>Main Matter, or <i>mainmatter</i>, is your story. It includes all chapters,
and possibly things such as Prologue, Epilogue, and anything else that
is part of the story. If there is a fictional Introduction (perhaps pretending
to be written by an archaeologist, who discovered the rest of the story in a
lost manuscript), then it is also mainmatter.</p>
<p>Mainmatter re-sets page numbering to arabic 1. If the layout has header
or footer, it will print, except header will not print above chapter openings.</p>
<p>If possible, write your story so that it ends mid-way on a recto page.
This presents the most pleasing appearance, especially if you have
something in backmatter.</p>

<a id="whatback"></a>
<h4>What is Back Matter?</h4>
<p>Back Matter, or <i>backmatter</i> is material added after the story ends.
It is common in academic non-fiction, where there may be a bibliography,
endnotes, appendix, index. But in the case of popular fiction, it is very rare
to use backmatter.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may place a very short "About the Author" in backmatter.
If you have Acknowlwedgements, it is better to put them in frontmatter at
the Visual Separator (page v), but you may also put them here. Commerically
published books may show movie posters, advertisements (no joke!) or other
irrelevant material. Don't do that.</p>
<p>If you use backmatter, it does not reset the page numbering (continues as
arabic within the PDF), but no page numbers or header/footer will print.</p>

<a id="lastpage"></a>
<h4>The Final Page</h4>
<p>No matter how your book ends (with or without backmatter), Novelette
will automatically add one or two blank pages, so that the final page of
the PDF is blank verso. This is required by print-on-demand. In some cases,
the manufacturer will add more blank pages.</p>
<p>The final verso page (blank in your PDF) may have a manufacturer code
added, at time of printing. This is not within your control.</p>
