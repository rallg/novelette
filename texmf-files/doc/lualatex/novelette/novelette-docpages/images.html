<h3 class="title">Interior Images</h3>

<p>Cover artwork is described on <a href="cover.html">another page</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Command: <code>\image[position]{content}[label]</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>[position]</code> is an optional code, setting the horizontal
and vertical image placement. Possible codes are explained below.</li>
<li><code>{content}</code> is the location and filename of a real image.
However, if not in final mode, you may create a fake image (gray rectangle)
half the width of text block, occupying an integral number of lines.
This is selected by using an integer, instead of a filename, for content.</li>
<li><code>[label]</code> is ignored for real images. If you use this option
for a fake image, it will write the label text inside the fake image.
Maximum 24 characters. A label does not need to have any relationship to
the subsequent real image.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">In Novelette, each image is a block element, occupying
its own paragraph or page. Images may not be placed inline with text.
They may not have text wrap around them. They may not be placed in header
or footer.</p>
<p>Interior images must be <code>png</code> format, with file extension
<code>png</code> or PNG</code>. They may be located in the same directory
as the main document, or in a subdirectory relative to the main document.
They may not be called by absolute path (/path on Linux, C://path on Windows).
They may not be called by rising up the directories, such as with ../path.</p>

<p>All real images must be monochrome flattened black/white without
transparency, 1-bit per pixel, 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm),
without private metadata, without attached color profile. However you create
an image, it must be processed to a new image using a script provided in
this documentation (Requires GraphicsMagick). The new image will have a
file name that Novelette will identify as a conformance code. When not in
final mode, Novelette will allow you to place a non-conforming image.
But in final mode, it will only accept processed images, with the code.</p>

<p>For best results: Create images in your graphics program. Retain the
original in its native format, color space, and resolution. Export a png
image that is 1-bit black/white at 600 pixels/inch. When that png looks
the way that it should, process it using the conformance script. If you
subsequently need to re-size or re-scale the image, work on the original.</p>

<p>During the early stages of writing, use fake images. "Write now,
do artwork later." As long as the final images occupy the correct vertical
space, text layout an pagination will be unchanged. The document log file
will show information about the correct image sizes to use.</p>




<p>The optional [position] is one or two letters, determining horizontal and
vertical placement:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of: clroi (center, left, right, outside, inside).</li>
<li>One of: hbtpn (float here/top, bottom, top, page, nofloat).</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">If you do not provide the horizontal alignment, default c.
If you do not provide the vertical placement, default h.</p>
<p>If you provide redundant or conflicting position codes, Novelette
does not generate a warning or error. Instead, it will guess your meaning
according to priorities.</p>
<p>You do not need to write ht. When you choose h, but it cannot
be done, then t is automatically used as alternate position.</p>
<p>If you choose n, and the image is too close to the bottom of
its page, then it moves to the following top, leaving blank lines behind.
However, n is the only vertical position allowed on display pages,
or within the opening environment. Any request for a different vertical
position will be ignored.</p>
