<h4>What is Frontmatter?</h4>
<p>Front Matter, or <i>frontmatter</i> is a standard publishing term. It refers
to the material that precedes the start of your story. It is
"information about the book, as a book" rather than "part of the story".</p>

<h4>Basic Six-Page Front Matter</h4>
<h5><code>\frontmatter</code> % Followed by six pages.</h5>
<p>Unless you have good reason to do otherwise, your frontmatter should be
exactly six pages. Regardless of page layout, none of them will print
header or footer (thus, no printed page numbers).</p>
<ul>
<li>Page i : Half-Title. This shows only the book title (not subtitle or
author). Its text size is usually larger than normal, but smaller than the
title that appears on the Title Page. You may use an image for the half-title
text.</li>
<li>Page ii : Frontispiece. This page is normally blank. If you have an
interesting illustration, you may put it here.
<ul>
<li>This is a good place for a map, as long as the main story does
not direct the reader to look for the map in a particular location.</li>
<li>Commercially published books may show a list of books by the same
author (or a movie advertisement!), but print-on-demand discourages that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Page iii : Title Page. This show the title, subtitle (if any), author,
and possibly a publisher identification. It should be as artistic as you
can manage, possibly using images.</li>
<li id="cprp">Page iv : Copyright Page. This all-important page shows the
title, subtitle, author, copyright holder, publisher information, ISBN,
disclaimer, and other items of a "legalese" nature. It is described in more
detail <a href="environments.html#copyrightpage">on another page</a>.</li>
<li>Page v : Visual Separator. This page faces the copyright page. When readers
open your book, you do not want them to see copyright legalese at left,
fictional story at right. So you provide something that separates them.
<ul>
<li>If your book uses a <a href="environments.html#dedication">Dedication</a>,
it goes here (nowhere else), regardless of whether frontmatter is six pages,
or more.</li>
<li>Without a Dedication, you could put a short Author's Note, or short
Acknowledgements, or an Epigraph, or
<a href="environments.html#contents">table of contents</a> (if the book is a
collection of short stories), or simply repeat the half-title. But this is not
the place to annoy your readers with personal information that detracts from
the story.</li>
</ul>
</li> 
<li>Page vi : Final page of frontmatter. This page faces the
start of your story. In most cases, it should be blank, so as not to detract
from the mood.
<ul>
<li>In rare cases, you may put something that leads into the story,
such as a map of the room where the body as found (for an English murder
mystery in a rural mansion) because readers expect it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Frontmatter does not print headers or footers (so no page numbers appear).
The PDF has internal page numbers i-vi. If you are a purist who prefers
uppercase Roman, write <code>\myroman{R}</code> in Preamble.</p>
<p>If you do not use the <code>\frontmatter</code> command, then do not
use <code>\mainmatter</code> either. The only reason you might do this, is if
you are mis-using Novelette for something other than a book. Naughty!</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<a id="aboutfm"></a>
<h5 class="details">More About Frontmatter</h5>
<p>In principle, nothing in frontmatter should relate to the story plot.
So although a decorative image (not part of the story) would be allowed,
a map (part of the story) would be disallowed. But modern practice often puts
maps in frontmatter, unless they need to be located near particular pages.</p>
<p>If your story is in the "lost manuscript" genre, in which a fictional
archaeologist (perhaps you, the author) tells about how the <i>Papyrus of
Heebie Jeebie</i> came to light, followed by a "translation" of the papyrus:
None of that belongs in frontmatter, because all of it (including the
archaeologist's tale) is part of the story. You might use
"Introduction" as the chapter title for the archaeologist's tale, followed
by Chapter 1 for the start of the  "translation".</p>
