<h4>What is Front Matter?</h4>
<p>Front Matter, or <i>frontmatter</i> is a standard publishing term. It refers
to the material that precedes the start of your story. It is
"information about the book, as a book" rather than "part of the story".</p>
<p>Novelette requires exactly six pages of frontmatter. The first five are
half-title, frontispiece (often blank), title page, copyright page, and
one of dedication/epigraph/note.</p>
<p>The final, sixth page of frontmatter is always blank. You do not create it;
Novelette automatically adds it there. It faces the first page of mainmatter,
where your story begins.</p>
<p>Frontmatter pages do not show headers or footers. Thus, they do not show
page numbers. Although they are described as pages i-vi, the PDF internally
labels page i as page 1, so that mainmatter is internally page 7.</p>

<a id="startfront"></a>
<h4>Start of Frontmatter</h4>
<h5><code>\frontmatter</code></h5>
<p>Frontmatter has five pre-defined, required page environments. They are
<code>pagei pageii pageiii pageiv pagev</code>.</p>
<p>None of the pages may extend to more than a single page. None of the
required pages may be omitted, or out of order. Nothing (except comments)
may be written in-between the page environments. If you violate any
of these rules, an error results.</p>

<div class="codeblock">

<div style="clear:both"></div>


<a id="pagei"></a>
<h4>Page i : Half-Title</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{pagei}</code> <i>content of half-title</i> <code>\end{pagei}</code></h5>
<p>Environment <code>pagei</code> is the <i>half-title page</i>. It contains only the
book title, not subtitle or author. It may be decorated, or in the form of an image.</p>
<p>Standard practice is to show the half-title using the same style as will
be used on the title page, but not as large.</p>
<p>Historically, the half-title was a dust cover for the real title page.
Nowadays it is a useful custom. Books without it are uncommon.</p>

<a id="pageii"></a>
<h4>Page ii : Frontispiece</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{pageii}</code> <i>content of frontispiece</i> <code>\end{pageii}</code></h5>
<p>Environment <code>pageii</code> is the <i>frontispiece</i>. It is required,
but it may be blank: <code>\begin{pageii}\end{pageii}</code> does that.</p>
<p>The frontispiece was traditionally an illustration in high-end books,
depicting something related to the story. Nowadays it is more likely to be
a movie poster, or an advertisement. Don't do that.</p>
<p>Commercial publishers sometimes list books by the same author. However,
print-on-demand discourages that, because each book is printed and distributed
independently of the others.</p>
<p>This is a good place to put a map of the story's world, or a diagram of
the crime scene, or the historical timeline, or character family tree,
or portrait of a prominent character, or illustration of a scene. It may also
be merely decorative, as long as it relates to the story's theme
(and looks good). There are three limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story cannot direct the reader to the frontispiece.
Ok: "They opened the map, and saw that Hortly was five furlongs to the north."
Bad: "The map is shown at the front of this book." If you must refer to a
map or other diagram, put it in mainmatter, near where it is mentioned.</li>
<li>The reader must be able to understand the story, without ever seeing
the frontispiece. So if it is a spy novel, and it revolves around a secret
message that the reader must decrypt, then it cannot be the frontispiece.</li>
<li>The frontispiece may not be part of the title page. That is, you may
not create a two-page spread, with part of the title at left (frontispiece)
and part of the title at right (actual title page).</li>
</ul>
<p>The frontispiece faces the title page, when the book is opened. Be sure
that they have visual harmony. If you lack artistic talent, it is better
to leave this page blank.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{pageii} % Page ii. Frontispiece.<br>

<a id="pageiii"></a>
<h4>Page iii : Title Page</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{pageiii}</code> <i>content of title page</i> <code>\end{pageiii}</code></h5>
<p>The <i>title page</i> must contain the title, subtitle (if any), and author
(may be pseudonym). You may also place the name of the publisher
(who is probably yourself), city and year of publication, at the bottom
of the page.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for using a decorative style, related to the genre
of your book. Consider using one or more images, instead of text. Whatever
you do, remember that print-on-demand requires that the title, subtitle,
and author be the same wherever they appear. You may use styling, but do not
be so creative that it is hard to discern the information.</p>

<a id="pageiv"></a>
<h4>Page iv : Copyright Page</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{pageiv}</code> <i>content of copyright page</i> <code>\end{pageiv}</code></h5>
<p>The <i>copyright page</i> is unique. Novelette forces you to use plain text,
without fancy styles or images. Certain content is required, and it must be
machine-readable. Hyphenation is disabled. Curly quotes are straightened.</p>
<p>The content will be horizontally and
vertically centered. Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.</p>
<p>You may use normal text, italics, small caps, and <code>\smalltext</code>.
Otherwise, no styling. If option <code>[freeform]</code>, you may also use
the center and/or blockindent environments.</p>
<p>A minimal copyright page contains these elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title : Subtitle / Author. This format is widely used. It may occupy more
than one line. The Author may be a pseudonym. If you provide the information
in a catalog block, lower on the same page, then you may omit it here.</li>
<li>Copyright Notice. You may paste the copyright symbol &copy; from a
Unicode character map, or write <code>\copyright</code>. It is common
to write both the word Copyright and the symbol. Do not use (c), and do not
use anything such as "copyleft." The copyright holder should be your real
name, not a pseudonym. Some books follow with lengthy hellfire and damnation
if anyone violates the copyright, but "All Rights Reserved" may suffice.</li>
<li>Disclaimer. Usually it says "This is a work of fiction...etc." See other
books in your genre for examples.</li>
<li>If you must acknowledge use of a Trademark (with permission), or similar
legal notice, you may describe it here. If you have your own Trademark
(such as publisher's emblem), you may describe it here.</li>
<li>Caution: Some new writers like to re-cycle a character or place name from
other books that are famous, and out-of-copyright. But the names may be
Trademarks, held by the estate of deceased authors. So, you can write a
historical romance involving William Shakespeare, but not a detective novel
featuring Hercule Poirot (Trademark), whether or not books using H.P.
are still in copyright.</li>
<li>Publisher. The name of the publisher (probably yourself), and place of
publication (probably the city where you live), must be shown,
along with a means of contacting the publisher. Commercial
publishers show their business address. Unless required, you probably do not
want to reveal your home address. It may suffice to provide the URL of a
web page. If in doubt, ask the distributor what to do. Remember that anyone who
needs the information, for legal purposes, can get it from the distributor.</li>
<li>ISBN (13-digit distribution identifier, in correct format with hyphens).
Unless your book will have limited copies, sold only to yourself for private
distribution by you, it will need an ISBN. Put the number here, but not its
barcode.
<ul><li>How do you get an ISBN? In some nations, there is a central
authority that provides them upon request. But in others, such as the USA,
that central authority is a private organization that sells them in bulk.
In that situation, ask the distribution service to provide the ISBN.
It may be free, or at low cost. At least one major print-on-demand service
insists on providing the ISBN.</li>
<li>When you get an ISBN from the service, it is registered
to them, not you. No problem, that is normal. But if you change the service,
you will need a new ISBN, and must change your document with the new number.</li>
<li>Avoid obtaining an ISBN from anyone who is neither the central
authority, nor your print-on-demand service.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some jurisdictions require <i>Impressum</i>, saying who printed the book,
and where it was printed. But in print-on-demand, this is beyond your control.
It may be added at time of printing, by a code on the final verso page
(which is why that page must be blank in your PDF). If in doubt, ask them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <code>pageiv</code> for the demo file. Your own book, being
original, will not mention Public Domain, but instead will have a firmly-worded
Copyright notice.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>

<a id="pagev"></a>
<h4>Page v : Dedication, Epigraph, or Note.</h4>
<h5><code>\begin{pagev} ... \end{pagev}</code></h5>
<p>It looks very bad if the legalese on <code>pageiv</code> (copyright) faces the start
of your story on page 1 of mainmatter. It ruins the mood.</p>
<p>Page v provides visual separation. There are three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedication. Not necessary, but often used, because it has little content.
Example:
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{pagev}<br>
\vfil<br>
\format{For Readers Everywhere}<br>
\vfil\vfil<br>
\end{pagev}
</code></div>
<a href="resources/dedication.png" target="new">Show image of dedication in new browser tab.</a>
</li>
<li>Epigraph. Requires more effort, but can be very effective. This is a
short piece of prose or poetry, that sets the mood for the story.
Typically, an epigraph is placed in a<code>blockindent</code>
environment, so that it does not occupy the full page width.
Caution: Commercial publishers have business deals that allow an author
to use the copyrighted words of someone else. You cannot do that.
Example epigraph:
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{pagev}<br>
\vfil<br>
\begin{blockindent}[4,4]<br>
\noindent When the lone wolf howls at dawn,\\<br>
And white birds twitter at noon,\\<br>
Then shall Durble arise and dance.\par<br>
\format[align=r]{--- \ital{Prophecy of Claudius}}<br>
\end{blockindent}<br>
\vfil\vfil<br>
\end{pagev}
</code></div>
<a href="resources/epigraph.png" target="new">Show image of epigraph in new browser tab.</a>
</li>
<li>Author's Note or Editor's Note. If used, this must be something that leads
into the story. It must be brief, and not look like a chapter. For example,
if your story set in a distant historical place and time, you may mention that
some of the persons and events were real. This is not the place to tell
about yourself. Example Author's Note:
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{pagev}<br>
\vfil<br>
\format[scale=1.15,font=light]{Author's Note}<br>
\null<br>
\begin{blockindent}[3,3]<br>
\noindent Lasagna was widely eaten in the late Roman Empire. However,
they did not have tomato sauce; tomatoes are native to the Western
Hemisphere.\par<br>
\end{blockindent}<br>
\vfil\vfil<br>
\end{pagev}

<div style="clear:both"></div>


<a id="pagevi"></a>
<h4>After Page v</h4>
<p>The last thing you write in frontmatter is the <code>pagev</code>
environment. Then Novelette automatically adds blank page <code>vi</code>
before the <code>\mainmatter</code> command.</p>
<p>Need more frontmatter? Too bad, so sad. Novelette does not have it.
In particular, there is no provision for a table of contents. Do not attempt
to extend frontmatter with a self-created table.</p>
<p>If Novelette detects that its mainmatter begins on the recto page that
immediately follows blank page vi, it will be happy. But if detects that
mainmatter begins later than that, it will complain.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/> top</a></p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>


<a id="subdoc"></a>
<h4>If Compiling Only Subdoc</h4>
<p>Novelette checks for correct usage in frontmatter. If something that should
be there is missing, or something that should not be there is present, or if
the required pages are in the wrong order, an error is issued.</p>
<p>But if you use <code>\subdoc</code> to compile only a portion of
frontmatter, Novelette only checks whatever pertains to the subdoc page(s).</p>
