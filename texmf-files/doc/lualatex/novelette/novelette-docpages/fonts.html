<h2 class="title">Fonts</h2>

<p>Unlike most other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not choose fonts
via <code>\usepackage{Font Name}</code>. Instead, you assign fonts to
pre-defined categories: <code>main sans mono alt drama deco</code>.</p>
<p>This page explains how the font categories are used, and how to assign
your choice of font to each category.</p>
<p>Novelette <i>requires</i> the included Swainson font, as main font.
The included Towhee font will automatically be used for footnotes. You may
not change these. Reason: It would take a lot of code branching, and waste
a lot of time, to calculate layout for different main fonts. Swainson/Towhee
are specifically designed for the intended purpose of Novelette. However,
you may change whether or not certain OpenType features are used.</p>
<p>You may define several additional font categories. These are described
below. But you may not create more categories/</p>

<a href="opentype.html">OpenType features</a> is on another page.</p>


<a id="mainfont">
<h4>\mainfont{<i>this command does not exist</i>}</h4>
<p>Just a reminder: You cannot choose the main font. If you attempt to
do that, an error results.</p>

<h4>\mainfeatures{<i>OpenType features</i>}</h4>
<p>You may add (or remove) OpenType features from the main font.
Normally, you do not need to do this, because the features you need
(which may depend upon language setting) are selected automatically.</p>

<h4>\sansfont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}</h4>
<p>Traditionally, TeX defined a sans-serif font, primary for use in math
expressions. But Novelette does not know, or care about, any math.
You may set the sansfont to be a serif font, if you wish. The default
is Swainson, same as main font.</p>

<h4>\sansfeatures{<i>OpenType Features</i>}</h4>
<p>Unless you command otherwise, the sans font will use the same features
as the main font.</p>

<h4>\monofont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}</h4>
<p>Traditionally, TeX defined a monospace ("typewriter") font, for use
in places where it was needed. But popular fiction has no need of monospace.
You may cheat, and use any font. However, certain adjustments, such as
kerning and character substitutions, are not automatically applied.
The default font is Swainson, but if you decide to define the mono font,
a better choice would be symbols or decorations, rather than flowing text.</p>

<h4>\monofeatures{<i>OpenType features</i>}</h4>
<p>Unless you command otherwise, no features are used, not even kerning
or automated "TeX Ligatures."</p>

<h4>\altfont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}</h4>
<p>The alt font is intended as a "fallback font," when you need characters
that are unavailable in Swainson. The substitution is not automatic; you must
request the alt font where-needed. when-needed.</p>
<p>Font <i>Libertinus Serif</i> is strongly recommended as the alt font.
It is available in TeX as package <i>libertinus-fonts</i>. This font plays
well with Swainson, and has a large character set. If you do not set the
alt font, Swainson will be used, but that defeats its purpose.</p>

<h4>\altfeatures{<i>OpenType Features</i>}</h4>
<p>Do what you need to do.</p>

<h4>\dramafont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}</h4>
<p>The defines a font that you may use for "dramatic effect," such as
on the book title page. If you do not set it, Swainson is used.</p>

<h4>\dramafeatures{<i>OpenType Features</i>}</h4>
<p>Do what you need to do.</p>

<h4>\decofont{<i>Individual Font File</i>}</h4>
<p>The defines a font that you may use for decorations. Unlike the other
font categories, this loads only a single font file, rather than
the regular/italic/bold/bolditalic family.</p>
<p>Beware: Some decorative fonts have their characters traced from drawings.
Often, such characters do not meet technical validation standards.
Novelette cannot check this. They may appear good, but be flagged by the
printer, because print-on-demand services use more stringent standards
than needed by a home printer. On the other hand, some non-valid characters
are acceptable.</p>

<h4>\decofeatures{<i>OpenType Features</i>}</h4>
<p>Do what you need to do.</p>

<h4>About Font Licenses</h4>
<p>It is your responsibility to determine whether you are licensed to use
fonts for your purpose. Presumably you intend commercial usage. Not all
"free" fonts allow that.</p>
<p><img src="images/warning.png" class="warning" alt="warning"/>
Do not use GPL (GNU Public License) fonts, unless they come with an
explicit font exception clause. Not all of them have it.</p>
<p>Some fonts are provided for use on platforms that have particular
software installed, only when using that software.</p>
<p>The SIL Open Font License (OFL) is one of several licenses that are
suitable. The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL), and related GUST font
license, are also good. There are others. If in doubt, read the license.</p>
