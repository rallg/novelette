<h2 class="title">Fonts</h2>

<p>Unlike most other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not choose fonts
via <code>\usepackage{Font Name}</code>. Instead, the main font must be
Swainson, which comes with Novelette. This font will also be used, possibly
with modifications, for page headers, footnotes, and chapter openings.
Although the font cannot be changed, you may set a few modifications.</p>
<p><a href="opentype.html">OpenType features</a> are discussed on
another page.</p>

<h4>About Swainson</h4>
<p>Why require Swainson? It was designed specifically for Novelette. It has
known features and metrics. The compiler does not need to waste time finding
information and performing calculations, because it already knows them.</p>
<p>Swainson is vaguely in the category of Garamond/Bembo/Caslon fonts. But it
was not derived from any of them, and is not a historical reproduction.</p>


<h3>Other Fonts</h3>
<p>You may choose up to three other fonts for special purposes.
These user-defined fonts may only appear on display pages, especially
the book title page, where you may wish to print artistic text.</p>
<p>If your artistic needs are more complicated, use images, and design the
artistic text into the images.</p>
<p>If you have font <i>Libertinus Serif</i> installed, it may be used as a
fallback font, as explained below.</p>

<h4>\styleafont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}{<i>features</i>}</h4>
<p>When <code>\styleafont</code> is defined in Preamble, it will be used
whenever you use the <code>\stylea{<i>text</i>}</code> command, on display
pages in document body. If you do not set this font, Swainson is used.</p>

<h4>\stylebfont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}{<i>features</i>}</h4>
<p>When <code>\stylebfont</code> is defined in Preamble, it will be used
whenever you use the <code>\styleb{<i>text</i>}</code> command, on display
pages in document body. If you do not set this font, Swainson is used.</p>

<h4>\stylecfont{<i>Font Family Name</i>}{<i>features</i>}</h4>
<p>When <code>\stylecfont</code> is defined in Preamble, it will be used
whenever you use the <code>\stylec{<i>text</i>}</code> command, on display
pages in document body. If you do not set this font, Swainson is used.</p>


<h4>Fallback Font</h4>
<p>Swainson includes the Latin-1 character set, plus many typographic elements.
But it does not include Eastern European, Greek, Cyrillic, or other world
languages. For the intended purpose (popular fiction in English, French,
German, Italian, Spanish, Catalan) Swainson has all you need.</p>
<p>If you need to write the occasional character from another language, you may
use the fallback font, <i>Libertinus Serif</i>. Novelette automatically
tweaks its characters, so that they blend well with surrounding Swainson.</p>
<p>Fallback is not automatic, because most books will not need it. If you
wish to enable fallback, you must do these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libertinus Serif must be installed. It is package
<code>libertinus-fonts</code>.</li>
<li>In Preamble, <code>\fallback{enabled}</code> tells Novelette to check
for Libertinus Serif (enabled if found, error if not found). Using
<code>\fallback{e}</code> does the same. Anything else is the default,
which is disabled.</li>
<li>Anywhere in the document, <code>\fallback{<i>text</i>}</code> prints
text in this font. If you use this command without enabling the font,
it is not an error, but a Warning message will appear in the log file,
and the text will probably be printed with its missing-character symbol.</li>
<li>Fallback is not automatic. You must request it where-needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Font Licenses</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to determine whether you are licensed to use
fonts for your purpose. Presumably you intend commercial usage. Not all
"free" fonts allow that.</p>
<p><img src="images/warning.png" class="warning" alt="warning"/>
Do not use GPL (GNU Public License) fonts, unless they come with an
explicit font exception clause. Not all of them have it.</p>
<p>Some fonts are provided for use on platforms that have particular
software installed, only when using that software.</p>
<p>The SIL Open Font License (OFL) is one of several licenses that are
suitable. The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL), and related GUST font
license, are also good. There are others. If in doubt, read the license.</p>
