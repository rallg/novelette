<h3>Fonts: No Choice!</h3>
<p>Unlike most other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not choose fonts
via <code>\usepackage{Font Name}</code>. It does not set fonts by
<code>\setmainfont</code> or <code>\rmfamily</code> or any other command.</p>

<h4>Main Font : Swainson</h4>
<p>Whether you like it or not, the main font is always Swainson, which comes
with Novelette. This font has Regular and Italic. Its character set includes
Latin-1, typographic support, small caps, lining/oldstyle numerals, and a few
other characters beyond Latin-1. In other words, it is well-suited to the
limited number of languages that Novelette supports. By using a specific font
with known properties, Novelette can do some things more accurately than would
otherwise be possible with arbitrary fonts.</p>
<p>Popular fiction has no need of bold fonts. Swainson "Bold" is actually a
copy of Regular, and "BoldItalic" is actually a copy of Italic. This trick
is for the purpose of keeping other software satisfied, in the event that
you work with an Editor who is not using TeX.</p>
<p>Swainson is vaguely in the category of Bembo/Caslon/Garamond fonts, but
is not a derivative or reproduction of any of them. It as designed using
the LaTeX Cochineal/Crimson fonts as reference models, but the glyph shapes
are noticeably different.</p>
<p>Swainson is released under the terms of the SIL Open Font License, v1.1,
and thus is suitable for commercial usage. The font is named after Swainson's
Thrush, a seasonal songbird.</p>


<h4>Stylistic Font : Towhee</h4>
<p>Swainson is the only font for main text (and footnotes), and is
the default font everywhere. In special places, such as page headers,
chapter openings, and title page, you may choose a stylistic font.</p>
<p>Novelette provides several Towhee fonts. These are not related, other than
by name. They are selected by choosing "font" as option to one or more of
these commands: <code>\name</code>, <code>\subname</code>,
<code>\formatX</code> (X = a, b, c, d, e, f) and <code>\layout</code>.</p>
<p>Towhee fonts are released under the terms of the SIL Open Font License,
v1.1, and thus are suitable for commercial usage. The fonts are named after
the Spotted Towhee, a seasonal songbird.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Towhee-Regular</i> is invoked by <code>font=sans</code>. It is similar
to Swainson-Regular, without serifs. Includes small caps, but not Italic.</li>
<li><i>Towhee-Light</i> is invoked by <code>font=light</code>. It does not
have small caps or Italic. Its lowercase letters are reduced-height uppercase.
This shape is particularly suitable for larger sizes, such as title page.</li>
<li><i>Towhee-Medium</i> is invoked by <code>font=dark</code>. It has only
uppercase letters (typing lowercase will print uppercase). Its style is very
different from Swainson. It is particularly suitable for dramatic page
headers.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Fallback Font: Libertinus Serif</h4>
<p>The Swainson character set is intentionally limited to Latin-1, plus
typographic support, plus a few other characters outside Latin-1.
This suffices for the intended languages of English, French, Catalan,
Spanish, Italian, and German.</p>
<p>Eastern European, Greek, Cyrillic, and other world languages are not
supported. However, if you need the occasional character for a word or
phrase, you may use a fallback font. This is not automatic. You must do
several things to make it work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the TeX package manager, to install <code>libertinus-fonts</code>.
This enables <i>Libertinus Serif</i> as fallback font, Regular and Italic.
It has a very large character set, and is automatically tweaked so that
its characters blend well with Swainson. Its license is SIL OFL v1.1.</li>
<li>In your Novelette document, command <code>\alt{<i>char</i>}</code>
to print <i>char</i> in the Libertinus Serif font. The <i>char</i> may be
one or more utf-8 text characters, Regular or Italic.</li>
<li>If you use <code>\alt</code> but did not
install <code>libertinus-fonts</code>, an error results.</li>
<li>You cannot use <code>\alt</code> within <code>\title</code>, or
<code>\author</code>, or within page headers/footers. These are places
where you should not be using fallback characters, so it is not a real
limitation.</li>
<li>If the fallback characters are modified (Italics, small caps, or other
features), write the modification inside the <code>\alt</code> command.
Wrong: <code>\ital{\alt{char}}</code>.
Correct: <code>\alt{\ital{char}}</code>.</li>
<li>Do not write <code>\alt</code> within stylistic text (Towhee).
It will look wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Need Something Dramatic?</h4>
<p>The book title page (and perhaps half-title) may benefit from using
an image, instead of text. This can create powerful visual effects that
connot be easily achieved by fonts, even if Novelette allowed more fonts.</p>
<p>If you use images, be sure that the decorative title will read the same
as text. That is, do not create an image so fancy that its letters are
no longer obvious.</p>
<p>In all cases, the copyight page must have the book title in ordinary
text.</p>
