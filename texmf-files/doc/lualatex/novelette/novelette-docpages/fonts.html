<h2 class="title">Fonts</h2>

<p>Unlike most other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not choose fonts
via <code>\usepackage{Font Name}</code>. Instead, you assign fonts to
pre-defined categories: <code>main sans mono alt drama deco</code>.</p>
<p>This page explains how the font categories are used, and how to assign
your choice of font to each category.</p>
<p>The default main font is Swainson, which come with Novelette. This font
is <a href="#swainson">described below</a>. You do not need to use it, but
you might like it.</p>
<p>Other defaults are either the same as the main font, or one of the
Latin Modern fonts. You may write an entire book without using any of these
other categories. But if you do wish to use them, you will get better results
if you assign your own choice of fonts.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding
<a href="opentype.html">OpenType features</a> is on another page.</p>


<a id="mainfont">
<h4>\mainfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>The "main font" is used in main body text, and is also used anywhere
you do not locally select a different font.</p>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setmainfont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Font Family</code> might be something such as "Adobe Garamond
Pro" or "Libertinus Serif" or "Clara". It does not
need to be a LaTeX font. You may use any OpenType or TrueType font, as long
as it is licensed for commercial usage.</li>
<li>The default mainfont is "Swainson", which comes with Novelette.
If you use Swainson, then the "Towhee" font will be used for footnotes.</li>
<li>Some fonts, such as "Latin Modern Roman", are not designed for the purpose
of popular fiction. They do not offer the same flowing readability as fonts
designed for the purpose.</li>
<li>The font family does not need Bold or BoldItalic. These are never used
in the main text of popular fiction.</li>
<li>Some OpenType features are pre-selected: <code>kern,liga,onum</code>.
That is, kerning, common ligatures, oldstyle numerals. You do not need to
write these features.</li>
<li>When the font is used in some locations, such as page headers, openings,
and display pages, the ligatures are not used. This is because such text
is often loose (greater space) or enlarged.</li>
<li>The TeX-specific "TeX Ligatures" are also pre-selected.</li>
</ul>

<a id="sansfont">
<h4>\sansfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setsansfont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default sansfont is Latin Modern Sans, which comes with LaTeX.</li>
<li>In principle, the sansfont should be be one of the sans-serif fonts.
In practice, you may set any font, including those that have serifs.</li>
<li>The sansfont might be useful in special locations, such as chapter
openings, and display pages.</li>
<li>In the document: <code>\sans{This text uses sansfont}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>

<a id="monofont">
<h4>\monofont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setmonofont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>You probably will not  need to use monospaced text.</li>
<li>The default monofont is Latin Modern Mono, which comes with LaTeX.</li>
<li>Unlike other fonts, the monofont default features do not include
kerning, ligatures, or oldstyle numbers.</p>
<li>A monospaced font is normally used for mathematics and tables, which
are outside the purpose of Novelette. But if you need a monospace font,
you may use it for special purposes. Or, you may assign a decorative font.</li>
<li>Some monospace fonts are designed to look like traditional typing, from a
mechanical typewriters. Others have a more modern design, and are used by
computer programmers.</li>
<li>In the document: <code>\mono{This text uses monofont}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>

<a id="altfont">
<h4>\altfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets an "alternate font" that you
can locally use, when you need characters that are not in the main font.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default is Latin Modern Roman, which comes with LaTeX. But you should
select your own alternate font.</li>
<li>A good general-purpose altfont is "Libertinus Serif". This font has a
large character set, and a design style that is inconspicious (usually) when
mingled with a different main font.</li>
<li>You can install Libertinus Serif via your TeX package manager. It is
package "libertinus-fonts" (not any other package with similar name).
You will still need to set <code>\altfont</code>.</li>
<li>Use of the altfont is not automatic. You must manually request it where
you need it: <code>\alt{This text uses altfont}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>

<a id="dramafont">
<h4>\dramafont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets a "dramatic font" that you
can locally use, for special effect. That might be on the book title page,
or in chapter openings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not necessarily need a dramatic font.</li>
<li>The default dramafont is same as mainfont.</li>
<li>To use it: <code>\drama{This is dramatic text}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>

</p>


<a id="decofont">
<h4>\decofont{<i>font-filename.otf</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets a "decorative font" that you
can locally use, for dingbats or other decorative elements.</p>
<p>Unlike the other font settings, decofont does not select a font family.
It selects a single font file, which you choose by its full file name,
with extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not necessarily need a decofont.</li>
<li>The default decofont is Swainson, same as mainfont. Note that Swainson
does not have any decorative characters, so this is not helpful.</li>
<li>The decofont default features do not include
kerning, ligatures, or oldstyle numbers.</li>
<li>To use it: <code>\deco{<i>character</i>}</code></li>
<li>Novelette does not support drop caps (multi-line first letter).</li>
<li><img src="images/warning.png" class="warning" alt="warning"/>
Beware: Some fonts have characters traced from drawings. These fonts may
fail validation tests at the manufacturer (Novelette will not complain).
If you are using such characters, it is better to convert them to raster
images.</li>

<a id="fontlicenses">
<h4>About Font Licenses</h4>
<p>It is your responsibility to determine whether you are licensed to use
fonts for your purpose. Presumably you intend commercial usage. Not all
"free" fonts allow that.</p>
<p><img src="images/warning.png" class="warning" alt="warning"/>
Do not use GPL (GNU Public License) fonts, unless they come with an
explicit font exception clause. Not all of them have it.</p>
<p>Some fonts are provided for use on platforms that have particular
software installed, only when using that software.</p>
<p>The SIL Open Font License (OFL) is one of several licenses that are
suitable. The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL), and related GUST font
license, are also good. There are others. If in doubt, read the license.</p>

<a id="swainson">
<h4>About Swainson and Towhee Fonts</h4>
<p>These OFL-licensed fonts were designed by the Novelette developer,
using FontForge software. The OFL-licensed <i>Cochineal</i> fonts were used
as reference, but the glyph shapes are different.</p>
<ul>
<li>Swainson is not a clone or revival or any other font. However, it has
the general readability of fonts such as Garamond, Bembo, and Caslon.</li>
<li>The character set includes Latin-1, plus a variety of punctuation and
typographic support, and a few letters outside Latin-1. Modern Western
European languages are supported, including Irish Gaelic and Welsh.
Some languages beyond Western Europe are also supported, such as Finnish,
Swahili, Afrikaans, Hawai'an, and Filipino.</li>
<li>Swainson does not support Eastern European languages. Novelette will
support languages such as Czech or Polish, but then you will need to use
a different font.</li>
<li>Whether or not you use Swainson, Novelette does not support right-to-left
languages, and does not support languages with stacked (multiple) diacritical
marks.</li>
<li>If you use Swainson as main font, then the related Towhee font will be
automatically used for small text (footnotes). Towhee is a modified form
of Swainson, intended for this purpose.</li>
