<h2 class="title">Fonts</h2>

<p>Unlike most other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not choose fonts
via <code>\usepackage{Font Name}</code>. Instead, the main font must be
Swainson, which comes with Novelette. This font will also be used, possibly
with modifications, for page headers, footnotes, and elsewhere.</p>


<h4>About Swainson</h4>
<p>Why require Swainson? It was designed specifically for Novelette. It has
known features and metrics. The compiler does not need to waste time finding
information and performing calculations, because it already knows them.</p>
<p>Swainson-Regular and Swainson-Italic are vaguely in the category of
Garamond/Bembo/Caslon fonts. But they were not derived from any of them.
Instead, the Cochineal/Crimson fonts were used as models, then the glyphs
were subsetted and heavily redesigned.</p>
<p>There is no need for bold fonts, in the kind of book intended. But since
the fontloader expects them, Swainson provides a Bold that is not bold,
and a Bold Italic that is neither Bold nor Italic. These fonts may be used
only as design alternatives in page headers. These fonts were redesigned
from Oswald Condensed and Cuprum fonts.</p>
<p>All Swainson fonts, and the originals that were used as models,
are released under the terms of the SIL Open Font License, v1.1.</p>


<h3>Fallback Font: Libertinus Serif.</h3>

<p>The Swainson character set is intentionally limited to Latin-1, plus
typographic support, plus a few other characters outside Latin-1.
This suffices for the intended languages of English, French, Catalan,
Spanish, Italian, and German.</p>
<p>Eastern European, Greek, Cyrillic, and other world languages are not
supported. However, if you need the occasional character for a word or
phrase, you may pick them from Libertinus Serif. This font was chosen
because it "plays well" when mingled with Swainson, it is well-designed,
and has a large character set. Novelette knows its properties, and tweaks
its characters for compatability.</p>
<p>Use of Libertinus Serif, as fallback font, is not automatic. First, you
must install TeX package <code>libertinus-fonts</code>. Although there are
other packages with "libertinus" in the name, you only need this one package.
If you happen to have those fonts in your operating system, you must still
install the TeX package, because the TeX file names may differ from the
file names distributed by others.</p>
<p>Novelette will not automatically find the fonts. You must write this
in Preamble:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\enable{libertinus}</code></p>
<p>Do not write the above, if you do not actually have the font installed.
Why this unusual method? The fontloader can waste a lot of time looking
for a font that may or may not be there, and it will do that every time
you re-compile a document. This method causes quicker failure.</p>
<p>Once installed and enabled, you may invoke Libertinus Serif on a
per-character basis (or group of characters) with <code>\alt{text}</code>:</p>
<p class="code">
<code>This is Swainson \alt{this is L.S.} again Swainson.</code></p>
<p>Novelette does not automatically substitute characters. You must
specifically use <code>\alt</code> when you need it.</p>
<p>The <code>\alt</code> command only works in main text, and footnotes.
It does not work in page headers, <code>\name</code>, <code>\subname</code>,
<code>\style</code>, or <code>\scene</code> commands.</p>
<p>The <code>libertinus-fonts</code> package also installs Libertinus Sans
fonts, which may be used in page headers with
<code>\layout{font=sans}<code>. See the <a href="XXXXX">layout</a> page.</p>
