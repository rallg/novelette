<h3 class="title">OpenType Features</h3>

<p>This page is under development.</p>

<p>OpenType features are font-specific. Some features, such as
<code>onum</code>, (oldstyle numerals) have a standard meaning, but not every
font will have them. Other standard features, such as <code>sups</code>
(superscripts) may include only numerals in one font, but more than just
numerals in another font. Yet other features, such as <code>ss01</code>,
have no standard meaning; two fonts may have that feature, but its effect
may be very different.</p>
<p>The only way to know, is to test the font.</p>

<p>In Novelette, OpenType features are selected by their four-character codes.
You may locally add features, or locally remove features that were selected
in Preamble. Removal is by negation: <code>-liga</code> removes common
ligatures.</p>

<p>Although Novelette relies on <code>fontspec</code> technology, your use
of fontspec commands is very limited. The reason is that fontspec allows
many variations that would work in a digital document, but fail when
commercially printed to paper. Novelette tries very hard to prevent you from
using things that may cause issues.</p>

<p>In general, any fontspec feature that uses the equal sign (=) is banned.
Example: You cannot use <code>Letters=SmallCaps</code>, but you may request
lowercase to small caps using <code>smcp</code> as a feature.</p>
<p>The one exception is the fontspec <code>Path</code> feature. You probably
will never need it, but Novelette allows it.</p>
