<h2>Novelette Fonts</h2>


<a id="mainfont">
<h4>\mainfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>The "main font" is used in main body text, and is also used anywhere
you do not locally select a different font.</p>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setmainfont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Font Family</code> might be something such as "Adobe Garamond
Pro" or "Libertinus Serif" or "Clara" or "Crimson Pro Regular". It does not
need to be a LaTeX font. You may use any OpenType or TrueType font, as long
as it is licensed for commercial usage.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to determine whether the chosen font is
properly licensed (free or paid) for your purpose. Do not use GNU Public
License fonts, unless their license comes with an explicit
Font Exception Clause.</li>
<li>The default mainfont is "Swainson", which comes with Novelette.
If you use Swainson, then the "Towhee" font will be used for footnotes.</li>
<li>Some fonts, such as "Latin Modern Roman", are not designed for the purpose
of popular fiction. They do not offer the same flowing readability as fonts
designed for the purpose.</li>
<li>The font family does not need Bold or BoldItalic. These are never used
in the main text of popular fiction.</li>
<li>Some OpenType features are pre-selected: <code>kern,liga,onum</code>.
That is, kerning, common ligatures, oldstyle numerals. You do not need to
write these features.</li>
<li>When the font is used in some locations, such as page headers, openings,
and display pages, the ligatures are not used. This is because such text
is often loose (greater space) or enlarged.</li>
<li>The TeX-specific "TeX Ligatures" are also pre-selected.</li>
<li>Additional information regarding Opentype Features is
<a href="novelette-opentype.html">on another page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a id="sansfont">
<h4>\sansfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setsansfont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default sansfont is Latin Modern Sans, because it comes with TeX.</li>
<li>In principle, the sansfont should be be one of the sans-serif fonts.
In practice, you may set any font, including those that have serifs.</li>
<li>The sansfont might be useful in special locations, such as chapter
openings, and display pages.</li>
<li>In the document text, <code>\sans{This text uses sansfont}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>
</ul>

<a id="monofont">
<h4>\monofont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command has identical effect to the <code>\setmonofont</code> command,
of the <code>fontspec</code> package. You may use either command.</p>
<ul>
<li>You probably will not  need to use monospaced text.</li>
<li>The default monofont is "Latin Modern Mono", which comes with LaTeX.</li>
<li>Unlike other fonts, the monofont default features do not include
kerning, ligatures, or oldstyle numbers.</p>
<li>A monospaced font is normally used for mathematics and tables, which
are outside the purpose of Novelette. But if you need a monospace font,
you may use it for special purposes.</li>
<li>Some monospace fonts are designed to look like traditional typing, from a
mechanical typewriters. Others have a more modern design, and are used by
computer programmers.</li>
<li>In the document text, <code>\mono{This text uses monofont}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>
</ul>

<a id="altfont">
<h4>\altfont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets an "alternate font" that you
can locally use, when you need characters that are not in the main font.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default altfont is Swainson, same as mainfont. But this is not
helpful. You should select your own alternate font.</li>
<li>A good general-purpose altfont is "Libertinus Serif". This font has a
large character set, and a design style that is inconspicious (usually) when
mingled with a different main font.</li>
<li>You can install Libertinus Serif via your TeX package manager. It is
package "libertinus-fonts" (not any other package with similar name).
You will still need to set <code>\altfont</code>.</li>
<li>Use of the altfont is not automatic. You must manually request it where
you need it, in the text: <code>\alt{This text uses altfont}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>
</ul>

<a id="dramafont">
<h4>\dramafont{<i>Font Family</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets a "dramatic font" that you
can locally use, for special effect. That might be on the book title page,
or in chapter openings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not necessarily need a dramatic font.</li>
<li>The default dramafont is Swainson, same as mainfont.</li>
<li>To use it: <code>\drama{This is dramatic text}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for mainfont.</li>
</ul>

<a id="decofont">
<h4>\decofont{<i>font-filename.otf</i>}[<i>OpenType Features</i>]</h4>
<p>This command is specific to Novelette. It sets a "decorative font" that you
can locally use, for dingabts or other decorative elements.</p>
<p>Unlike the other font settings, decofont does not select a font family.
It selects a single font file, which you choose by its full file name,
with extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not necessarily need a decofont.</li>
<li>The default decofont is Swainson, same as mainfont. Note that Swainson
does not have any decorative characters, so this is not helpful.</li>
<li>Unlike other fonts, the decofont default features do not include
kerning, ligatures, or oldstyle numbers.</li>
<li>To use it: <code>\deco{<i>character</i>}</code></li>
<li>Also see the above information for helpful.</li>
</ul>
