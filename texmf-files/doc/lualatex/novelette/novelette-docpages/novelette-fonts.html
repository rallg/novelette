<p><b>Novelette has its own commands for fonts.<br>
DO NOT \usepackage{fontname}.</b></p>


<h3>Swainson and Towhee Fonts</h3>

<p>Novelette comes with its own Swainson and Towhee font families.
They are designed for popular fiction, with commercial usage allowed.
Although they are not clones or revivals, they are in the general style
of well-known book fonts such as Garamond, Caslon, and Bembo.</p>
<p>They are the default fonts: Swainson for main text, headings, and
other locations; Towhee for footnotes (looks better at small size).</p>
<p>Swainson and Towhee contain the Western European character sets, plus
typographic support. They do not contain Eastern European, Greek, Cyrillic,
or any other language sets.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you may use any other font, as long as it is licensed for
your usage. This is your responsibility. Do not use any "GPL" licensed font,
unless it has a font exception clause.</p>
<p>Novelette uses LaTeX <code>fontspec</code> technology, with additional
support from LuaLaTeX. If you are interested in heavy customization of fonts,
see the <code>fontspec</code> package documentation. But if you would rather
not learn more code, and just write your book, then take advantage of
Novelette's simple, built-in settings.</p>


<h3>Main Font (Typeface)</h3>

<p>The main font is used for all parts of the book, except where
you locally choose something else. Novelette calls it the "typeface".
To change it from default Swainson, here is the Preamble setting:</p>

<p><code>\typeface[open type features]{Font Family Name}</code></p>

<p>The font family name may be something such as "Libertinus Serif"
or "Adobe Garamond Pro".</p>
<p>Novelette pre-selects <code>kern</code> (kerning), <code>liga</code>
(common ligatures), and <code>onum</code> (oldstyle numerals) from among
the available OpenType features. Unless you have specific need of
somehing else, leave [open type featues] empty. Keep in mind that some
features are font-specific, and will produce unexpected results if you
change the font.</p>


<h3>Alternate Font</h3>

<p>Some fonts (such as Swainson/Towhee) have a limited character set.
If you need to write the occasional character that is not part of the
main typeface, you can set an alternate font. In Preamble:</p>

<p><code>\altfont[open type features]{Font Family Name}</code></p>

<p>A good general-purpose font is Libertinus Serif. You can get it by using
your TeX package manage to install package <code>libertinus-fonts</code>.</p>

<p>To write some text using the altfont:</p>
<p><code>\alt{This text is in altfont.}</code></p>

<p>Note that Novelette does not automatically switch to the altfont.
If you need to use it, you must ask for it, as above.</p>


<h3>Sans and Mono Fonts</h3>


<h3>Drama and Deco Fonts</h3>
