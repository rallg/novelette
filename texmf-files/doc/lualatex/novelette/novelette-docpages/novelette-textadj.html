<h2>Text Adjustment Settings</h2>

<p>These are Preamble settings. They affect how text will be typeset,
in main text and in some special locations. The purpose is to provide
a uniform appearance throughout the book.</p>

<a id="namestyle">
<h4>Name Style</h4>
<p>Every chapter has a "name", which is its chapter title. The name may
be just a number, or it may be a full line of text. It may not continue
to more than one line.</p>
<p>Some non-chapter content may use the same name style. This might include
Prologue, Epilogue, Introduction, About the Author, and so forth.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\namestyle{align=<i>A</i>,font=<i>F</i>,scale=<i>S</i>}</code></p>
<p>See this <a href="images/namesubname.html">example</a> for how it is used.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>align=<i>A</i></code> determines the horizontal alignment, where
<i>A</i> is one of <code>l c r o i</code> (left, center, right, outside inside).
Default <code>align=c</code>.</li>
<li><code>font=<i>F</i></code> determines which font will be used for the
name text. <i>F</i> is one of <code>main sans mono alt drama deco</code>.
Default <code>font=main</code>.</li>
<li><code>scale=<i>S</i></code> sets the scale of name text, relative
to main font size. <i>S</i> is a number between 1 and 3 (decimals allowed).
Default <code>scale=1.6</code>, which looks nice in chapter names.</li>
<li>This is a global setting. You may locally over-ride it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upnamestyle">^return</a></p>

<a id="namestyle">
<h4>Subname Style</h4>
<p>The use of subnames is optional. Typical use of a subname is beneath
a chapter name, to provide a one-line description of the chapter.
A subname may not extend to more than one line, but you may write several
subnames.</p>
<p>Example: Chapter name is "3". Chapter subname is "At the Farmhouse".</p>
<p>Command: <code>\subnamestyle{align=<i>A</i>,font=<i>F</i>,scale=<i>S</i>}</p>
<p>The settings have the same meaning as with <code>\namestyle</code>,
except that the default subname scale is 1.25.</p>

<a id="setmicrotype">
<h4>\setmicrotype{<i>settings</i>}</h4>
<p>Novelette uses the <code>microtype</code> package for improved appearance
of body text. Since the package does not load until after Preamble,
this command provides a way to "PassOptionsToPackage" when
<code>microtype</code> loads.</p>
<p>If you do not know what that means, simply ignore it. Novelette is pre-set
to values that are good for its purpose. You do not need this command.</p>
<p>If you do wish to play with this command, Novelette will not let you
use the microtype draft mode. Microtype will always be in its own final mode,
no matter what you choose via <code>\mode</code> in Novelette.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upsetmicrotype">^return</a></p>

<a id="myparindent">
<h4>\myparindent{<i>size</i>}</h4>
<p>Novelette pre-sets the default paragraph indent at <code>1.5em</code>.
That looks good for the purpose intended. But if you need a different default
value, use <code>\myparindent</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>\myparindent{10pt}</code> for a small indent.</li>
<li>This is a global setting. If you need to locally change the indent,
that is performed using other commands in body text.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmyparindent">^return</a></p>

<a id="warnpercent">
<h4>\warnpercent{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>TeX uses the percent character % for comments. Anything following %,
on the same line of raw text (prior to typesetting) will be ignored.</p>
<p>If you need to print the percent character, you may use a
backslash <code>\%</code> there.</p>
<p>Default <code>\warnpercent{off}</code> does nothing.
But <code>\warnpercent{on}</code> issues a Warning if you use the
un-escaped % anywhere in body text. It does not warn for Preamble.
This is a way to detect accidental
use of % (which means comment) when you really meant to print %.</p>
<p>In body text, you may use <code>\memo{This does not print.}</code>
where you need it. The difference between memo and %, is that after the
memo completes, anything following it will print.</p>
<p>If you use this to issue a Warning, then the PDF will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>The <i>novelette-docpages</i> directory has a file named "warnmebro.tex".
You may edit it with warnpercent on or off, for comparison.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upwarnpercent">^return</a></p>

<a id="warnquotes">
<h4>\warnquotes{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>TeX normally converts straight double quotes " to right curly quotes ‚Äù.
Alas, some writers (<i>moi</i>) are in the habit of typing " with the
expectation that a smart-quotes feature will alternately convert them
to left and right curly quotes, as needed. That is not what TeX does,
so the print will be wrong. This is often hard to notice.</p>
<p>Default is <code>\warnquotes{off}</code>.
If you use <code>\warnquotes{on}</code> then Novelette will issue a Warning if
you wrote " anywhere in the document body. It does not warn for Preamble.</p>
<p>Since Novelette uses UTF-8 text encoding, you may directly paste left
and right curly quotes from a character map. Or, you may use <code>``</code>
(two acute characters, also known as backticks) for left curly quotes, and
two <code>''</code> (straight single quotes, also known as straight
apostrophe) for right curly quotes.</p>
<p>If you use this to issue a Warning, then the PDF will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>This documentation directory has a file named "warnmebro.tex".
You may edit it with warnquotes on or off, for comparison.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upwarnquotes">^return</a></p>

<a id="warnalert">
<h4>\warnalert{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>Novelette sometimes writes ALERT messages to the log file. These are
not Errors, or Warnings. Usually, an ALERT means that you set something
to an unusual value. Did you really mean that, or not?</p>
<p>Default <code>\warnalert{off}</code>. If you use <code>\warnalert{on}</code>
then a Warning will be issued if there were any Novelette-caused ALERTs.</p>
<p>It may be that the ALERT was thrown by a situation that you should fix.
Or maybe it is what you intended, so no need to fix it. When you are satisfied
that nothing needs to be fixed, turn <code>\warnalert{off}</code>.</p>
<p>If you use this to issue a Warning, then the PDF will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>This documentation directory has a file named "warnmebro.tex".
You may edit it with warnalert on or off, for comparison.</p>
