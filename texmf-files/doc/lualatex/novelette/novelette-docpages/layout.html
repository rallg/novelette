<h2 class="title">Book Trim Size and Page Layout</h2>

<p>This page is under development.</p>

<p>The width and height of book interior pages is its <b>trim size</b>.
Larger paper is fed into the printing machine, then trimmed (cut)
to final size during binding.</p>
<p>Always use off-white (cream, creme) paper for popular fiction. Choose
a trim size from among the standards offered by the print service.
Beware: The most commonly-used sizes for commercial publishing (sold in
large quantity to libraries and stocked on bookseller shelves) may or
may not be the best sizes for print-on-demand softcover fiction.</p>


<a id="trimsize"></a>
<h4>Trim Size</h4>
<p>The <i>trim size</i> is the width and height of book interior pages.
This is an industry standard term. Novelette does not provide a default
setting. If you do not set it yourself, an immediate fatal error results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\trimsize{w=<i>width</i>,h=<i>height</i>}</code></li>
<li>Width and height have units of <b>in</b> (inches) or <b>mm</b>
(millimeters).</li>
<li>Height may not be less than width.</li>
<li>Novelette does not check the size against a standard list. Unless the
setting is absurdly small or large, what you set is what you get.</li>
</ul>

</p>


<a id="sheetfeed"></a>
<h4>Sheet Feed</h4>
<p><i>Do not use this command unless necessary.</i></p>
<p>Novelette normally produces PDF page size that is equal to the trim size.
This is how nearly all print services want it.</p>
<p>If you are printing a copy on your home printer, perhaps for manual
editing, most printers will have no problem placing the PDF pages on
whatever paper you feed. But in the event that your printer does not know
what to do, then sheetfeed may help. Be sure to remove this command,
before the final PDF.</p>
<p>In rare instances, your print service may ask you to do this, perhaps
if there is a human editor. Do not do it unless explicity requested.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\sheetfeed{<i>paper</i>}</code></li>
<li>The <i>paper</i> is <code>letter</code> or <code>A4</code>.</li>
</ul>

</p>


<a id="margins"></a>
<h4>Margins</h4>
<p>In Novelette, the four margins are boundaries of a rectangle.
This rectangle is the <b>printable area</b>. All content (including header,
footer, main text, and images) must fit within the printable area.</p>
<p>This illustrates an open book spread, for a page layout that has both
header and footer. Printable area has white background. Non-printable margins
are gray. Note that each inside margin is slightly wider than
the outside margins:</p>

<table class="margins" cellspacing="0px"><tbody>
<tr>
<td class="m">&nbsp;</td><td class="m">top margin</td><td class="m br">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
  <td class="m">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td class="m">top margin</td><td class="m">&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">o</td><td>header</td><td class="m br">i</td>
  <td class="m">i</td><td>header</td><td class="m">o</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">u</td><td class="g">(empty hgap)</td><td class="m br">n</td>
  <td class="m">n</td><td class="g">(empty hgap)</td><td class="m">u</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">t</td><td>main body verso</td><td class="m br">s</td>
  <td class="m">s</td><td>main body recto</td><td class="m">t</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">s</td><td>main body verso</td><td class="m br">i</td>
  <td class="m">i</td><td>main body recto</td><td class="m">s</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">i</td><td>main body verso</td><td class="m br">d</td>
  <td class="m">d</td><td>main body recto</td><td class="m">i</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">d</td><td class="g">(empty fgap)</td><td class="m br">e</td>
  <td class="m">e</td><td class="g">(empty fgap)</td><td class="m">d</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">e</td><td>footer</td><td class="m br">&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="m">&nbsp;</td><td>footer</td><td class="m">e</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="m">&nbsp;</td><td class="m">bottom margin</td><td class="m br">&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="m">&nbsp;</td><td class="m">bottom margin</td><td class="m">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<p>Some word processors do not define "margins" the same way. Instead, they
place the header within the area of the top margin, and place the footer
within the area of the bottom margin. If the print service suggests margins,
be sure that the values account for the way Novelette does it, not the way
a word processor does it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\margins{t=<i>top</i>,o=<i>outside</i>,b=<i>bottom</i>,i=<i>inside</i>}</code></li>
<li>Example: \margins{t=.5in,o=.5in,b=.5in,i=.625in}</li>
<li>Each margin has units of <b>in</b> (inches) or <b>mm</b> (millimeters).</li>
<li>If you set any margin, then you must set all four of them.</li>
<li>Inside margin is generally wider than outside margin, because inside margin
includes the glue binding area. Typical extra width is 3mm or 0.125in.</li>
<li>Novelette does not allow page bleed. All margins must have a value greater
then zero.</li>
<li>Print services require minimum margins. The defaults are 13mm
top, outside, and bottom; 16.2mm inside. This appears to meet the requirements
of all known print-on-demand services. Some allow smaller values.</li>
<li>Artistic effects, such as an extra-wide outside or bottom margin, may be
rejected by the print service. This is because the humans who handle the pages
have never seen your book before, and may think that the printer was mis-fed.</li>

<a id="typesize"></a>
<h4>Type Size (Main Font Size)</h4>
<p>Novelette uses the term <b>typesize</b> to mean the size of the main
body text, measured in units of <b>pt</b> (TeX points), or <b>bp</b>
(PostScript points).</p>
<p>You do not need to set typesize, since Novelette will guess a value
(11 to 12 pt, usually in between) based on various other settings.
It is often best to accept the guessed value. But if you wish to do it
yourself...</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\typesize{<i>size</i>}</code></li>
<li>The <i>size</i> has units of <b>pt</b> or <b>bp</b>.</li>
<li>This is a Preamble setting. You cannot change it later in the book.
However, larger or smaller text will be used in special locations.</p> 
<li>You cannot set the leading, known to TeX as <i>baselineskip</i>. It will
automatically be calculated from other settings.</li>
</ul>

</p>


<a id="lines"></a>
<h4>Lines Per Page (Main Text Block)</h4>
<p>You do not need to set the number of lines per page. Novelette will
calculate a good value, based on other settings. But if you wish to do it
yourself...</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\lines{<i>integer</i>}</code></li>
<li>The <i>integer</i> is lines per page in the main text block, not counting
header or footer.</li>
<li>This is a Preamble setting. You cannot change it later in the book.</li>
</ul>

</p>


<a id="layout"></a>
<h4>Header and/or Footer Layout</h4>
<p>Although Novelette has a default layout, it is not always best. So be sure
to read this, and choose a layout that works for you.</p>
<p>Novelette does not allow you to construct your own layout. You must
choose one of several pre-defined schemes. Just about every book, in the
popular fiction of public libraries, will have one of these schemes. Yes, the
developer did look through the library shelves.</p>
<p>Non-fiction books often have distinctive page headers, because the book
will be read slowly. But fiction books normally have simple page headers,
because the book will be read quickly. Resist the temptation to create
distracting page headers.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\layout{scheme=<i>I</i>,hgap=<i>H</i>,fgap=<i>F</i>,font=<i>T</i>}</code></li>
<li><i>I</i> is an integer 1-7. It chooses whether layout has header and/or footer,
and alignment of content. The choices are described and illustrated in the
<a href="schemes.html">gallery of layout schemes</a>.
Default scheme is 2.</li>
<li><i>H</i> is a number from .5 to 1. It sets the
extra vertical space between header and main text, measured in lines.
Value .5 inserts a half-high empty line. Value 1 inserts a full empty line.
You may use values in-between. Default 1.</li>
<li><i>F</i> is like hgap, except it sets space between main text block
and footer. Default 1.</li>
<li><i>T</i> is an integer 1-4. Default 1 uses Swainson Regular/Italic,
same as main text (but tweaked). Choices 2 and 3 provide more dramatic
header/footer. Choice 4 requires package <code>libertinus-fonts</code>
installed, and <code>\enable{libertinus}</code> in Preamble.</li>
</ul>

<a id="guides"></a>
<h4>Guides</h4>
<p>Guides can assist with visual alignment, on pages that use white space,
such as the upperpage environment.
You can see <a href="shade.html">an example</a>.</p>
<p>Guides do not force anything. They do not affect the layout.
How you set guides, and whether or not you obey them, is up to you.
There are no default guides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <code>\guides{<i>up to four comma-separated integers</i>}</code></li>
<li>The integers are number of main text lines, from top of main text.<li>
<li>Example: <code>\guides{8,12,15,22}</code> sets four guide pairs.</li>
<li>This is a Preamble setting. It cannot be changed later in the book.</li>
<li>Guides may be set regardless of mode. But they are only visible when
in <code>shade</code> mode.</li>
<li>The bottom edge of guides is at main text baselines. The top edge is
as the normal x-height.</li>
</ul>
