<h2>Page Layout</h2>
<p>This page does not discuss cover artwork.</p>


<p>Command: <code>\layout{style=S,hgap=H,fgap=F,num=N}</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>style=S</code> requires S=integer, 1 to 7. Each number selects
the global page style: Whether it has a header and/or footer, and how
items are aligned there. The choices are described in detail, below.</li>
<li><code>hgap=H</code> is the header gap. It is the additional line space
from the header to the top line of main text. The value of H is a decimal
number from 0 to 1. Value 0 is rarely used, because it would place the header
immediately above main text, with no extra space. Value 1 produces a whole
empty line between header and main text. A value of 0.5 is often used.
If there is no header isn the page style, the hgap setting is ignored.</li>
<li><code>fgap=F</code> is the footer gap. It is the additional line space
between the last line of main text and the footer. Same considerations
as with hgap.</li>
<li><code>num=N</code> set the style of numerals used for page numbers.
It is a one or two letter code, described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>When layout uses a header, then every page reserves space for a header,
even if nothing is printed there. Same with footer.</p>
<p>When the numeral style uses Italics, then lowercase roman numerals
(sometimes seen in frontmatter) will also be italicized. Note that
the numeral style does NOT determine whether roman or arabic numerals
are used; that is determined by frontmatter and mainmatter.</p>
