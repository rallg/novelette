<a id="need"></a>
<h4>Need a Cover?</h4>
<p>If your book is a print-on-demand softcover, using "Perfect Print"â„¢
manufacturing (this is probably the case), then Novelette can help you
convert an RGB raster cover image into a CMYK PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant file,
with selected Output Intent.</p>
<p>Novelette does not have the capability for hardcover book covers.
If your book is hardcover, then you will need to process its cover by
some other method.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="really"></a>
<h4>Is This Really Necessary?</h4>
<p>You may or may not need to do this. Some print services will accept
an ordinary RGB raster image, or PDF file, then do the print-ready
conversion for you. If that is the case, let them do it. Nevertheless,
you may benefit from creating a softproof copy of your artwork, with its
colors reduced to the printable gamut, using Novelette's
<a href="#cmyk"><code>cmyk4nvt</code> script</a>.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="design"></a>
<h4>How to Design?</h4>
<p>Novelette cannot design the cover. Do that in a graphics program.
If you wish to use LaTeX for cover design, then you will need to create
the artwork using a different document class, then rasterize its PDF to
300 pixels/inch. Novelette can process the raster image.</p>
<p>The cover image must be complete, including all text built into the
image itself. Novelette does not write text on top of the image.</p>
<p>However you design the cover, export the image to a flattened raster
format. Any of jpg, jp2, png, tif will work. If using a lossy format, use
a high quality.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="what"></a>
<h4>What to Expect?</h4>
<p>Your cover will be printed on glossy white, heavyweight stock paper.
It may be finished with a glossy or matte overlay (some services
allow you to choose).</p>
<p>The technology uses CMYK, essentially an industrial-strength version of
a home or office color printer. However, in order to ensure rapid processing,
you must comply with a "total ink limit" (also known as TAC, Total Area
Coverage).</p>
<p>Each of the four ink channels may deliver up to 100% ink coverage
in any area. So, the maximum total is 400% ink. Actual printers do not reach
400%, because that is too much ink for the paper to hold without smearing.
High-quality commercial books may allow 325% or more. Your book will have a
lower limit. Many print services limit to 240%. When it processes your artwork,
Novelette assumes this 240% limit.</p>
<p>What that means: The CMYK gamut (range of available colors) is less than
the range of colors that you can see on computer monitors. Also, a monitor
generates light, whereas printed paper reflects light. The result is
that you can see many brilliant colors on your screen, but not get them
in print.</p>
<p>The 240% ink limit is important when colors are dark yet colorful. It takes
a lot of ink to make a very dark black (more than just black ink). It takes
a lot of ink to make dark browns, deep blues, deep greens. Some colors, such
as richly-colored purples, cannot be produced by CMYK at all.</p>
<p>Script <a href="#cmyk"><code>cmyk4nvt</code></a> produces a softproof of your image.
The softproof is an ordinary RGB image with sRGB color profile attached.
It will show you what to expect (more or less) when your image is printed.</p> 
<p>If you wonder how commercial publishers create covers with deep blacks
and rich colors: They are not limited to CMYK. When covers are printed
in quantity using commercial offset presses, they can use "spot colors" which
are pre-mixed coloring agents that go beyond CMYK.</p>

<h3>The Cover Document</h3>
<div class="codeblock">
<p class="codeblock">
<a href="#magic"><code>% !TeX TS-program = lualatex<br>
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</code></a><br>
<a href="#documentclass"><code>\documentclass{novelette-cover}</code></a><br>

% Anything written here, after end document, is ignored.
</p>
</div>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="magic"></a>
<h4>Magic Comments</h4>
<p>Although they are not required, it is helpful to write these two lines
at the very top of your document (including the % symbol):</p>
<p class="codeblock"><code>
% !TeX TS-program = lualatex<br>
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8
</code></p>
<p>Those are "magic comments" that are understood by some GUI programs,
such as TeXworks. They tell the program how to compile your document.</p>
<p>If you are compiling from command line, the magic comments are ignored.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>


<a id="documentclass"></a>
<h4>Document Class: <code>novelette-cover</code></h4>
<p>The cover documentclass is <code>novelette-cover</code>,
not <code>novelette</code>.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>


<a id="title"></a>
<h4>Title</h4>
<p>The title for cover is not necessarily the same as the book title.
If the book title is "My Wonderful Story" then the cover title might be
"COVER FOR My Wonderful Story". All this affects is internal PDF metadata.
Novelette does not care. Your print service might require a particular
title.</p>
<p>Your print service is likely to require a specific filename for the
cover PDF, and a specific filename for the interior PDF. The files will
be processed by filename. The title, in PDF metadata, is secondary.</p>
<p>If you do not provide a title, then the cover will be processed in
draft mode, and "DRAFT COVER FOR Untitled Document" will be the default.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="author"></a>
<h4>Author</h4>
<p>The cover author is normally identical to the book interior author.
This is not the place to credit the artist, if you use a design service.</p>
<p>If you do need to credit an artist, do one or both of these: (a) Put the
artist's name somewhere on the rear cover. (b) Mention the artist (as artist)
on the Copyright Page. But be sure that your agreement with the artist
specifies that <i>you</i> are the copyright holder, not the artist (work for hire).</p>
<p>If you do not provide an author, then the cover will be processed in
draft mode, and "Anonymous Author" will be the default.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="mode"></a>
<h4><code>\mode</code> is not set</h4>
<p>For the cover, you do not set <code>\mode</code>.</p>
<p>If the cover is processed without error, then the mode is automatically set
to final. If error, then the mode is automatically set to draft, and the word DRAFT
appears in the PDF metadata title. An error might be caused by badly-sized image,
validation failure, or missing settings.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="intent"></a>
<h4><code>\intent{<i>setting</i>}</code></h4>
<p>The available choices for intent are the same, for cover and interior.
Default is SWOP, "U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2", a widely-used American
standard. You may use different intent for cover and interior, although
this is unlikely.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="trimsize"></a>
<h4><code>\trimsize{<i>setting</i>}</code></h4>
<p>You must provide <i>exactly the same</i> <code>\trimsize</code> for the cover,
as you used for the book interior. This setting will be used as part of
a "sanity check", to warn you if the cover size is not appropriate for the
trim size of the book.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="covertrim"></a>
<h4><code>\covertrim{w=<i>width</i>,h=<i>height</i>}</code></h4>
<p>This is NOT the dimensions of the full cover image, with its bleed.
Instead, this is the size of the finished cover, after bleed has been trimmed away.</p>
<p>Its height must be exactly the same as the height of the book interior.
Its width must be twice the book width (for back and front covers),
plus the spine width.</p>
<p>Once you know the number of pages, the print service will tell you what
the spine width must be.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose the book size (interior trim size) is w=5.5in,h=8.5in.
Based on page count, its spine width is 0.644in. Then its covertrim width
is (5.5 + 0.644 + 5.5) = 11.644in. Its covertrim height is 8.5in (always
the same as book height). The image will be somewhat larger than this,
because it has bleed area on all sides.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="imagereq"></a>
<h4>Cover Image Requirements</h4>
<p>The image must be pre-processed by <code>cmyk4nvt</code> script,
as described below.</p>
<p>The image must include bleed on all four sides. Typically, print services
require minimum bleed of 3mm or 0.125in at each side.</p>
<p>The above example showed a covertrim of w=11.644in, h=8.5in. Using
American bleed width 0.125in, the cover image (with bleed) must be designed
to (0.125 + 11.644 + 0.125) = 11.894in wide, (0.125 + 8.5 + 0.125) = 8.75in high.</p>
<p>Since the required resolution (pixel density) is 300 pixels.inch, the image
with bleed will be (11.894 x 300) = 3568.2 pixels wide, BUT the value must be
rounded UP to integer, so the image will be 3569 pixels wide. The image height
will be (8.5 x 300) = 2550 pixels.</p>
<p>You do not provide these dimensions in Preamble. Novelette measures them.</p>
<p>Caution: Novelette will use 300 pixels/inch for cover image,
whether you like it or not.</p>

<a id="cmyk"></a>
<h3>Using <code>cmyk4nvt</code> Script</h3>
<p>If your print service accepts an RGB image, then you do not need to
do any of this. But if the print service requires CMYK, then use the
<code>cmyk4nvt</code> script. This is a BASH command-line script, located
with its companion files in the <i>novelette-scripts</i> directory
of its documentation.</p>
<p>Note: Eventually, I hope to provide the batch script for Windows.
But I cannot test it yet (not having Windows). If you happen to have
Windows 10+ with Linux subsystem, you can use the BASH script there.</p>
<p>To use the script:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have GraphicsMagick installed. This is the program that does
the work. Novelette script merely tells it what to do. GraphicsMagick is
available on nearly all Linux platforms, from the program installer.
It is freely available for Windows (including Portable), and I am told
that there is a "brew" version for Mac OS/X.</li>
<li>Copy the entire <i>novelette-scripts</i> to your home directory, or to
some other location where you have read/write privileges without needing
superuser or root.</li>
<li>Your input image must be raster (jpg, jp2, png, tif) RGB. If it has
a color profile attached, it will be used. If not, the image is assumed to
be in sRGB color space. The image must already be at 300 pixels/inch.
The script does NOT resample an image. The output will be labeled as
300 pixels/inch, even if that differs from the input (meaning, it will
print wrong).</li>
<li>Place the image in the script directory. Open a Terminal there,
then command:<br>
<code>bash cmyk4nvt YourImageFilename.ext</code><br>
where "ext" is the image extension (jpg, jp2, png, tif). The image filename
must not contain spaces or underscore (you may use hyphen).</li>
<li>Processing may take awhile (almost a minute, on my small machine).
When it is done, it will tell you.</li>
<li>The process leaves the original untouched, and produces two new images.
One image is "YourFileName-softproof.jpg". This is an RGB image in sRGB
color space. View it in any image viewer. It emulates the effect of CMYK
print at 240% ink limit. Dark areas will be less dark than in the original,
and some vivid colors will appear duller. If you cannot accept the result,
then you may need to re-design the original, so that it can exist within
the limited color space. Note that it does not help to increase chroma
(colorfulness) or contrast in the original. The changes are due to the
limitations of printing. You may discard the softproof, if you wish.</li>
<li>The other new image has filename "YourFileName-nvtcN.jpg" where N
is a multi-digit number. This image is in CMYK color space, at 240% ink
limit, without attached color profile. You will use it for the PDF.</li>
<li>If you wish, you may change "YourFileName" to something else, but the
"-nvtcN.jpg" part must be retained as-is. This encodes some image properties.
When Novelette creates a PDF, it will read internal image data, and
compare to the code. If they do not match, then Novelette knows that you
did not process the image using <code>cmyk4nvt</code> script, and the image will be
rejected.</li>
<li>The encoded filename may depend on which version of GraphicsMagick you used.
This is not a problem. Novelette knows what to do, even if you move the image
to another machine.</li>
<li>Although most image viewers can open the processed CMYK image, they will
not display correct colors. It is deceptive. Everything will appear more vivid.
This is because most image viewers use a quick algorithm for converting
CMYK to RGB, which is wrong for this kind of image. Only the softproof has
a reasonable emulation. If you have an advanced image editor (such as GIMP)
and run it in softproof color mode, using the inklimit240.icc file as
image color profile, then what you see will match the softproof. Indeed,
this is a good way to design the original image, since the colors you see
during design are already emulated as if they were CMYK.</li>
<li>After converting the image, use "YourImageName-nvtcN.jpg" as
coverimage for the *.tex document. It must be located in the same directory
as the *tex document, or in a subdirectory from there. You cannot use
absolute path, and you cannot use ../ to move up.</li>
<li>The PDF is processed quickly, because the heavy lifting was already done.
If you view the PDF in most PDF readers, its colors will be wrong. They
will appear more vivid than they will print. If you are on Windows (maybe Mac)
then Adobe Reader "may" show reasonably correct colors, because it
can intelligently guess what you mean.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Demo Cover</h3>
<p>In the <i>novelette-demo/cover</i> folder is <i>riverboat.jp2</i>. It is
in RGB color space. You may use it for testing.</p>
<p>Follow the above instructions, to get the RGB softproof and encoded
CMYK image.</p>
<p>Edit the <i>novelette-demo-cover.tex</i> file. Change the coverimage file name
to the encoded name from <code>cmyk4nvt</code> script. Then process it with lualatex.</p>
<p>The resulting PDF will be CMYK, 240% ink limit, PDF/X-1a:2001, with
Output Intent "U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2". If viewed in most PDF readers,
its colors will appear more vivid than they will print, because most PDF
readers do not correctly convert the CMYK color space.</p>
