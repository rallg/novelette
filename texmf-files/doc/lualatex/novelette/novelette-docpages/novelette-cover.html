<h2>Cover Image</h2>

<p>NOT YET COMPLETE. DO NOT USE></p>

<p>If your book is a print-on-demand softcover, using "Perfect Print"
manufacturing (this is probably the case), then Novelette can help you
convert a raster cover image into a PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant file,
with selected Output Intent.</p>
<p>Novelette can not design the cover. If you wish to do that using LaTeX,
use a different documnent class to produce the cover PDF, then convert that
to a raster image (png or jpg) using graphics software. Novelette will be
able to handle the raster image.</p>
<p>The cover image must be complete, including all text built into the
image itself. Novelette does not write text on top of the image.</p>
<p>Novelette does not have the capability for hardcover book covers.</p>
