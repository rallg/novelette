<h2>Fatal Errors, Ordinary Errors, Warnings, and Alerts</h2>

<p>This page describes messages issued by Novelette itself. It does not
describe Errors or Warnings issued by TeX, usually when your document has
a syntax error due to mis-typing. Novelette provides helpful messages.
As for TeX messages... Never mind.</p>
<p>In this <i>novelette-docpages</i> directory is a file, <i>warnmebro.tex</i>.
Copy it to your home directory, and play with it. The compiler will throw
various Errors, Warnings, or ALERTs, when you edit the text. Instructions
are in the file itself.</p>

<h3>Fatal Errors</h3>

<p>In certain situations, Novelette issues a fatal error. The compiler
will immediately stop, and will not let you continue. This occurs if
you did something (or failed to do something) that cannot produce the PDF.</p>
<p>For example, you must provide the <code>\booksize</code> dimensions.
There is no default. Without booksize, there is a fatal error.</p>
<p>A fatal error produces no PDF. If you already have a PDF from previous
compile, it may still be there (or not).</p>


<h3>Ordinary Errors</h3>

<p>When Novelette issues an ordinary error, the compiler will halt,
and wait for your response. You may be able to continue, by simply
hitting the Return key. But it is better to respond "x" and stop.</p>
<p>Novelette can catch an ordinary error that is thrown by TeX or
component packages.</p>
<p>If you continue past an ordinary error, it may (or may not) be able
to finish, producing a PDF. The PDF may (or may not) look good. But because
there was an error, it will not be in final mode.</p>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>When Novelette issues a Warning, the compiler does not stop. The PDF
will be produced. It may or may not look good. However, it will not be in
final mode.</p>
<p>If the Warning was issued by TeX or a component package, Novelette
does not prevent final mode. This is because some packages are unduly
verbose, with unnecessary warnings. You will have to decide what to do.</p>


<h3>ALERTs</h3>

<p>Novelette will issue an ALERT message, when you did something that is
perfectly allowable, but may or may not be what you meant to do.</p>
<p>These alerts are from the developer's own experience as a writer.
They concern a few situations where the behavior of a word processor differs
from the behavior of TeX.</p>
<p>An ALERT does not stop processing, does not issue an Error or Warning
(unless requested), and does not prevent final mode. All it does is leave
a message in the log summary. Then, you can decide whether or not
it is important.</p>
<p>An ALERT is issued in the following circumstances. They only apply within
the document body. Anything preceding <code>\begin{document}</code>,
or following <code>\end{document}</code>, will not cause an ALERT.</p>


<h4>Alert When % Used</h4>
<p>The un-escaped percent symbol <b>%</b> is a TeX comment. Anything following
it, on the same line of input text, will not print. But is that really what
you meant? Did you type "It was only 30% correct" and intend that % to print,
not as a comment? Novelette cannot read you mind, so it issues an ALERT
to the log summary, if it sees an un-escaped % symbol.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you intend the % to print, then escape it with backslash, as <b>\%</b>
instead.</li>
<li>If you intended the % to begin a comment, then use
<code>\memo{<i>comment goes here</i>}</code> instead. But there is a
difference between % comment and memo: After the memo closes, anything on
the same line of input text will print.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Alert When " Used</h4>
<p>Other than special-purpose coding (not normally used in a document),
TeX automatically substitutes right curly quotes ” (Unicode 201D) for
straight double quotes " (Unicode 0022) wherever they are found.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of us are in the habit of typing quotes "like this",
because a word processor will selectively substitute quotes left and right,
“like this”. But TeX will print ”like this”. Oops.</p>
<p>Novelette issues an ALERT, if it sees straight double quotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you really mean to print straight double quotes, write
<code>\sraightdblquote</code> there. You may need to follow with space.</li>
<li>If you really mean curly quotes, you can paste the actual left and right
curly quotes from a character map. Or, you can use TeX code <b>``</b>
(two graves, also known as backticks) for the left, and <b>''</b>
(two apostrophes, also known as straight single quotes) for the right.</li>
</ul>

<a id="warnalert">
<h4>\warnalert{<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>}</h4>
<p>You may write this command in Preamble. Default is off. If you write
<code>\warnalert{on}</code> then any ALERT message is converted to a Warning,
which will be detected by GUI software. It will also prevent final mode.</p>
