<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>A <i>typographic flaw</i> is not an error. It is something with poor
typesetting. A book with many typographic flaws will provide a poor reader
experience.</p>
<p>When a portion of your book is near completion, Novelette can inspect it
for a variety of typographic flaws. Nothing is corrected. Instead, the PDF
will have its flaws highlighted in color, and a separate *.typo file will
describe them.</p>
<p>The only way to correct typographic flaws is to edit your writing. But it
is hard to correct all flaws, partly because some are unimportant, and partly
because correcting a flaw may introduce a new flaw.</p>
<p>The method for finding flaws does not depend on language.</p>


<a id="mode"></a>
<h4><code>\mode{typo}</code> or <code>\mode{typo*}</code></h4>
<p>This Preamble command invokes typo mode. It is a form of draft mode,
so the PDF will have metadata identifying it as not final.</p>
<p>In the PDF, typographic flaws will be highlighted by coloring the problem
text (or possibly a colored bar in the margin). Also, a plain-text file
with extension <i>typo</i> will be created, listing the flaws and pages.</p>
<p>Typo mode does not correct anything. The paragraphs and page breaks are
unchanged. The only difference is coloration.</p>
<p>With <code>\mode{typo}</code>, non-highlighted text remains black. With
<code>\mode{typo*}</code>, non-highlighted text become light grey, so that
the highlighted text is more prominent. Otherwise, they are the same.</p>


<a id="flawlist"></a>
<h4>List of Typographic Flaws</h4>
<p>These are not errors. They do not prevent the PDF from being produced in
final mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widows and Orphans : A widow is the last line of a paragaph,
placed as the first line of the following page. An orphan is the first line
of a paragraph, placed as the last line in its page.</li>
<li>Short final line of paragraph : The final line of a paragraph
should extend beyond the indent of the following paragraph. In many languages,
the standard indent is 1em, and the final line must extend at least 2em.</li>
<li>Almost-full final line of paragaph : When the final line of a
paragraph almost reaches the right margin, the reader may be surprised when
the following line is a new paragraph. If the final line does not leave at
least 1em gap before the right margin, that is a flaw. Note that it should not
be considered a flaw if the following line is blank; but it will nevertheless
be flagged as a flaw. Exception: If the final line exactly reaches the margin,
it is assumed to be intentional, so it is not marked.</li>
<li>Poor hyphenation : There are several flaws: two or more consecutive
hyphenated lines; hyphenated final line of paragraph; hyphenation across
page break. Note that this is not a test of proper language-specific word
hyphenation.</li>
<li>Duplicate start or end of consecutive lines : If consecutive lines
begin or end with the same word, or same several characters, it is visually
confusing.</li>
<li>One-letter word at right margin : If the last word on
a line is single-letter, it may be a flaw. Capital letters are flagged, because
they usually indicate the start of a sentence. You may use
<a href="#onechar"><code>\onechartypo</code></a>
to add others, such as "a" and "o".</li>
<li>Two-letter word at right margin : If the last word on a line is
two-letters, it may be a flaw. You may use
<a href="twochar"><code>\twochartypo</code></a> and
<a href="twochar"><code>\twochartypo*</code></a>
to list the words, where the starred list is less urgent.</li>
<li>Overfull line : Line is too long for margins.</li>
<li>Excessive stretch : During paragraph typesetting, characters and
spaces may be stetched or shrunk by a tiny amount, for line justification.
If the amount is large, it will be highlighted.</li>
</ul>


<a id="onechar"></a>
<h4><code>\onechartypo{}</code></h4>
<p>When a line ends with an isolated capital letter, it is flagged as a flaw.
English "I" may be a false flag (or not). Otherwise, the capital letter
indicates the start of a sentence, which must not be single-letter at line end.</p>
<p>You may add more letters using <code>\onechartypo{list}</code>.
The list is space-separated single letters, case-sensitive, with diacriticals
where needed. For example, <code>\onechartypo{a}</code> might be useful
in English.</p>


<a id="twochar"></a>
<h4><code>\twochartypo{}</code> and <code>\twochartypo*{}</code></h4>
<p>When a line ends in a two-character word, it may be a flaw. There is no
built-in list of two-character words.</p>
<p>If you wish to flag two-character words at the end of lines,
use <code>\twochartypo{list}</code>. The list is space-separated, case-sensitive,
with diacriticals where needed. The starred command is for words that
have a less-prominent flag. For example, English might use
<code>\twochartypo{If In Is}</code> and <code>\twochartypo*{an of}</code>.</p>


<a id="typofile"></a>
<h4>The *.typo file</h4>
<p>When you compile in typo mode, a file with extension <i>*typo</i> is
generatedin the same folder as your main document. It lists flaws in the order
they were detected, by page and line.</p>
<p>A book may contain hundreds of flaws. They are ranked in importance.
When the description of a flaw immediately follows its line number, that is
more important than when the description is spaced away from the number.
The more the space, the less the importance.</p>
