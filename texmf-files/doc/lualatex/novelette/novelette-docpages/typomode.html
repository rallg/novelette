<h2>Typo Mode</h2>

<p>When a portion of your writing is near completion, you may use typo mode
to inspect the PDF for typographic flaws. These are areas where the
typesetting is not ideal. In some cases, you may choose to accept flaws,
either because they are unimportant, or because any change would introduce
more serious flaws. But if you correct as many flaws as possible, then your
printed book will look much better.</p>

<p>Novlette does <i>not</i> automatically correct typographic flaws. Although
there are various LuaLaTeX packages for that purpose, you cannot use them.
Instead, the only way to correct flaws is to re-write the text there. This is
why Novelette is intended only for original fiction. You can always use more
or fewer words, or different words.</p>

<p>In some languages, specific flaws are serious defects. Novelette does not
distinguish them from lesser flaws. That is your job!</p>


<h3><code>\mode{typo}</code> or <code>\mode{typo*}</code></h3>

<p>This Preamble command invokes typo mode. It is a form of draft mode,
so the PDF will have metadata identifying it as not final.</p>

<p>In the PDF, typographic flaws will be highlighted by coloring the problem
text (or possibly a colored bar in the margin). Also, a plain-text file
with extension <i>typo</i> will be created, listing the flaws and pages.</p>

<p>Typo mode does not correct anything. The paragraphs and page breaks are
unchanged. The only difference is coloration.</p>

<p>With <code>\mode{typo}</code>, non-highlighted text remains black. With
<code>\mode{typo*}</code>, non-highlighted text become light grey, so that
the highlighted text is more prominent. Otherwise, they are the same.</p>


<h3>List of Typographic Flaws</h3>

<p>These are not errors. They do not prevent the PDF from being produced in
final mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widows and Orphans &emdash; A widow is the first line of a paragaph,
placed as the last line of a page. An orphan is the last line of a paragraph,
placed as the first line of a page.</li>
<li>Short final line of paragraph &emdash; The final line of a paragraph
should extend beyond the indent of the following paragraph. In many languages,
the standard indent is 1em, and the final line must extend at least 2em.
Enlgihs uses 1.5em indent, but retains the 2em length.</li>
<li>Almost-full final line of paragaph &emdash; When the final line of a
paragraph almost reaches the right margin, the reader may be surprised when
the following line is a new paragraph. If the final line does not leave at
least 1em gap before the right margin, that is a flaw. Note that it should not
be considered a flaw if the following line is blank; but it will nevertheless
be flagged as a flaw.</li>
<li>Poor hyphenation &emdash; There are several flaws: two or more consecutive
hyphenated lines; hyphenated final line of paragraph; hyphenation across
page break. Note that this is not a test of proper language-specific word
hyphenation.</li>
<li>Duplicate start or end of consecutive lines &emdash; If consecutive lines
begin or end with the same word, or same several characters, it is visually
confusing.</li>
<li>One-letter or two-letter word at right margin &emdash; If the last word on
a line is single-letter (such as English I or Spanish o) it is a flaw.
The flaw is more serious if it is a capital letter, beginning a sentence.
It may also be a flaw in the case of two letters. This is configurable.</li>
<li>Overfull line &emdash; Line is too long for margins.</li>
<li>Excessive stretch &emdash; During paragraph typesetting, characters and
spaces may be stetched or shrunk by a tiny amount, for line justification.
If the amount is large, it will be highlighted.</li>
</ul>


<h3><code>\twoletter{}</code> same as <code>\twoletters{}</code></h3>

<p>When a single-letter word (such as "I" or "a") is at the right
end of a line, it is flagged as a flaw. Novelette has a list of single-letter
words in the various languages it understands. They will all be inspected,
regardless of your language setting.</p>
<p>Single-letter words: <code>A À E È I O Ô Y a à e è i o ô y</code></p>
<p>In some cases, this is a real flaw (example: English "I" beginning a
sentence). In other cases, it is not a real flaw, although it is flagged.
Only you can decide.</p>

<p>Novelette can also check when a line ends with a two-letter word. But there
are many of them in the various languages, so Novelette only checks a few that
might begin a sentence (first letter uppercase) and are unusually short
(using I or J).</p>
<p>Basic two-letter words: <code>If Il Im In Io Is It Ja Je</code></p>
<p>If you need to add more, use <code>\twoletters{which words}</code> with a
space-separated list of two-letter words to be added to the default list.
The letters are case-sensitive. Use diacritical marks, if needed.</p>

<p>Example for French: <code>\twoletters{Au De Le La Si On Ma Tu}</code></p>

<p>The list does not care which language you use. You may also add words
such as <code>Ed</code> (an abbreviated given name, in English) if there
is a character named Ed in your story.</p>

<p>If a two-letter word is followed by punctuation, it is not highlighted.
Example: <code>Ha!</code> in English. You do not need to list it.</p>
