<h2>Typo Mode</h2>

<p>When a portion of your writing is near completion, you may use typo mode
to inspect the PDF for typographic flaws. These are areas where the
typesetting is not ideal. In some cases, you may choose to accept flaws,
either because they are unimportant, or because any change would introduce
more serious flaws. But if you correct as many flaws as possible, then your
printed book will look much better.</p>

<p>Novelette does <i>not</i> automatically correct typographic flaws. Although
there are various LuaLaTeX packages for that purpose, you cannot use them.
Instead, the only way to correct flaws is to re-write the text there. This is
why Novelette is intended only for original fiction. You can always use more
or fewer words, or different words.</p>

<p>The method for finding flaws does not depend on language.</p>


<h3><code>\mode{typo}</code> or <code>\mode{typo*}</code></h3>

<p>This Preamble command invokes typo mode. It is a form of draft mode,
so the PDF will have metadata identifying it as not final.</p>

<p>In the PDF, typographic flaws will be highlighted by coloring the problem
text (or possibly a colored bar in the margin). Also, a plain-text file
with extension <i>typo</i> will be created, listing the flaws and pages.</p>

<p>Typo mode does not correct anything. The paragraphs and page breaks are
unchanged. The only difference is coloration.</p>

<p>With <code>\mode{typo}</code>, non-highlighted text remains black. With
<code>\mode{typo*}</code>, non-highlighted text become light grey, so that
the highlighted text is more prominent. Otherwise, they are the same.</p>


<h3>List of Typographic Flaws</h3>

<p>These are not errors. They do not prevent the PDF from being produced in
final mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widows and Orphans &emdash; A widow is the last line of a paragaph,
placed as the first line of the following page. An orphan is the first line
of a paragraph, placed as the last line in its page.</li>
<li>Short final line of paragraph &emdash; The final line of a paragraph
should extend beyond the indent of the following paragraph. In many languages,
the standard indent is 1em, and the final line must extend at least 2em.
English uses 1.5em indent, but retains the 2em length.</li>
<li>Almost-full final line of paragaph &emdash; When the final line of a
paragraph almost reaches the right margin, the reader may be surprised when
the following line is a new paragraph. If the final line does not leave at
least 1em gap before the right margin, that is a flaw. Note that it should not
be considered a flaw if the following line is blank; but it will nevertheless
be flagged as a flaw. Exception: If the final line exactly reaches the margin,
it is assumed to be intentional, so it is not marked.</li>
<li>Poor hyphenation &emdash; There are several flaws: two or more consecutive
hyphenated lines; hyphenated final line of paragraph; hyphenation across
page break. Note that this is not a test of proper language-specific word
hyphenation.</li>
<li>Duplicate start or end of consecutive lines &emdash; If consecutive lines
begin or end with the same word, or same several characters, it is visually
confusing.</li>
<li>One-letter word at right margin &emdash; If the last word on
a line is single-letter, it may be a flaw. Capital letters are flagged, because
they usually indicate the start of a sentence. You may use \onechartypo
to add others, such as "a" and "o".</li>
<li>Two-letter word at right margin &emdash; If the last word on a line is
two-letters, it may be a flaw. You may use \twochartypo and \twochartypo*
to list the words, where the starred list is less urgent.</li>
<li>Overfull line &emdash; Line is too long for margins.</li>
<li>Excessive stretch &emdash; During paragraph typesetting, characters and
spaces may be stetched or shrunk by a tiny amount, for line justification.
If the amount is large, it will be highlighted.</li>
</ul>


<h3><code>\onechartypo{}</code></p>

<p>When a line ends with any of XXXXX, it is flagged as a flaw. English "I"
may be a false flag (or not). Otherwise, the capital letter indicates the
start of a sentence, which must not be single-letter at line end.</p>
<p>You may add more letters using <code>\onechartypo{list}</code>.
The list is space-separated single letters, case-sensitive, with diacriticals
where needed. For example, \onechartypo{a} might be useful in English.</p>

<h3><code>\twochartypo{}</code> and <code>\twochartypo*{}</code></h3>

<p>When a line ends in a two-character word, it may be a flaw. There is no
built-in list of two-character words.</p>
<p>If you wish to flag two-character words at the end of lines,
use <code>\twochar{list}</code>. The list is space-separated, case-sensitive,
with diacriticals where needed. The starred command is for words that
have a less-prominent flag. For example, English might use
\twochartypo{If In Is} and \twochartypo*{an of}.</p>


<h3>The *.typo file</h3>

<p>When you compile in typo mode, a file with extension *typo is generated
in the same folder as your main document. It lists flaws in the order they
were detected, by page and line.</p>
<p>A book may contain hundreds of flaws. They are ranked in importance.
When the description of a flaw immediately follows is line number, that is
more important than when the description is spaced away from the number.
The more the space, the less the importance.</p>
