<h4>Images vs. Icons</h4>
<p>In Novelette, the <code>\image</code> command places its content as a
block element, in its own paragraph. Using options, you may choose its
horizontal alignment, and vertical placement (float). Wherever it is placed,
it occupies an integer number of text lines. Novelette automatically pads it,
to preserve the surrounding line grid.</p>
<p>The <code>\icon</code> command places its content inline, with other text.
It has no options. The width of the icon occupies that much space within
the text. The height of the icon is very limited, so that it fits on a single
line of text without pushing against the lines above or below it.</p>
<p>You may place an <code>\image</code> anywhere except page header/footer.
An <code>\icon</code> may be placed anywhere, including page header
(but not footer).</p>

<a id="fmtloc"></a>
<h4>File Format and Location</h4>
<p>Novelette allows only one graphics file format: <i>png</i>. If you attempt
to place any other format, or if you write a graphics filename without its
<i>png</i> file extension, an error results.</p>
<p>The graphics file may be located in the same directory (folder) as the main
document. Or, is may be located in a subdirectory relative to the main
document. But you may not use an absolute path, and you may not use
<code>../</code> to move up a directory. The purpose of this restriction
is to ensure that if you move or copy the folder containing the main document,
all of its content is moved or copied with it.</p>

<a id="fmtreq"></a>
<h4>Graphics File Specifications</h4>
<p>When not in final mode, Novelette does not inspect graphics files.
As long as they are <i>png</i> files with extension, they will be printed.
This allows you to defer final graphics processing until later.</p>
<p>However, be sure that the graphics files are at 600 pixels/inch
(232.22 pixels/cm). If they are not, then you will have a rude surprise when
the files are processed for final mode.</p>
<p>In final mode, Novelette will only permit <i>png</i> files that have been
pre-processed by script <code>mono4nvt</code>, as explained below. This
ensures that the files comply with stringent printing standards. If a file
was not processed by that script, then an error is issued, and the PDF
reverts to draft mode.</p>
<p>Inspecting <i>png</i> files takes time, so do not use final mode until your
writing and editing is close to completion.</p>

<a id="fake"></a>
<h4>Fake Graphics</h4>
<p>Novelette allows you to place "fake graphics" in draft mode.
A fake <code>\image</code> or <code>\icon</code> does not refer to an actual
<i>png</i> file. Instead, it reserves vertical or horizontal space, where you
will later place a real file. This allows you to continue writing, then do
the graphics later.</p>
<p>A fake image is displayed as a gray rectangle, of specified size. If the
real file is that size, then paragraphs and pagination will be preserved.
But if the real size is different, then paragraphs may reflow or
pagination may change.</p>
<p>If you use fake graphics in final mode, an error results.</p>


<h4>Block-Element Images<br>
<code>\image[<i>position</i>]{<i>content</i>}[<i>label</i>]
</code></h4>
<p>The <code>\image</code> command places its content as a block element,
in a paragraph by itself. It may not be written within a paragraph, or
attached to an incomplete paragraph.</p>
<p>The maximum width of an <code>\image</code> is the textblock width.
Its maximum height is the textblock height. Regardless of the image height,
Novelette will automatically pad its top or bottom, so that it occupies an
integer number of text lines. This preserves the line grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional <code>[position]</code> sets the horizontal and vertical image
placement. Possible codes are explained below.</li>
<li><code>{content}</code> may be real or fake. If <i>content</i> is a
filename, with <i>png</i> extension, it is real. If <i>content</i> is an
integer, without any extension, it is fake. A fake image is half the width of
the textblock, and occupies that integer number of vertical lines.</li>
<li>Optional <code>[label]</code> is ignored for real images. If you use this
option for a fake image, it writes the label inside the gray rectangle.
Maximum 24 characters. A label does not need to have any relationship to the
subsequent real image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The optional <code>[position]</code> uses comma-separated <i>key=value</i>
pairs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>align=A</code> where A is one of <code>l c r o i</code>
(left, center, right, outside, inside). Default <code>c</code>.</li>
<li><code>float=F</code> where F is one of <code>h t b p n</code>
(here, top, bottom, page, nofloat). Default <code>h</code>, except forced
<code>n</code> within upperpage and display pages.
Choice <code>h</code> is identical to <code>ht</code> (here, alterate t).</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>float=n</code>, and the image is too close to the bottom of its
page, then it moves to the following top, leaving blank lines behind.</p>

<a id="icon"></a>
<h4>Inline Icons<br>
<code>\icon{<i>content</i>}</code></h4>
<p>The <code>\icon</code> command places its content inline. Its width may be
as much as the textwidth, but in most cases an icon is much narrower.</p>
<p>The maximum height of an icon is <i>1.1em</i>, where the <i>em</i> size
refers to surrounding text. In main text, <i>em</i> is the <i>typesize</i>,
whether set by you or by default. In scaled text (such as <code>\name</code>),
<i>em</i> is also scaled.</p>
<p>The bottom of the icon is always placed at <i>0.26em</i> beneath the
baseline of surrounding text. This is slightly deeper than the descenders
of Swainson font.</p>
<p>At the maximum height of 1.1em, the top of an icon will rise 0.84em above
the baseline. This is the height of accented uppercase letters in Swainson.</p>
<p>A fake icon is written as <code>\icon{N}</code> where N is a positive number
(may be decimal). This reserves width equal to <code>N</code>em.</p>
<p>You do not need to worry about an icon descending into the bottom margin,
because descenders are already taken into account.</p>

<a id="mono"></a>
<h4>Processing with Script <code>mono4nvt</code></h4>
<p>Final mode requires that every <i>png</i> files be pre-processed
by script <code>mono4nvt</code>. This is a BASH command-line script. It does
not require special privileges, as long as you can read/write files.</p>
<p>To use this script, you must have program <i>GraphicsMagick</i> installed.
The script reads your <i>png</i> file, calls <i>GraphicsMagick</i>,
and produces a new <i>png</i> file with encoded file name. You must place this
new file into your document, not the original file.</p>
<p>This is what the script does:</p>
<ul>
<li>It removes any transparency (flattens), and coverts the file to monochrome
black/white space at 1-bit per pixel.</li>
<li>It removes private metadata. It does not attach a color profile.</li>
<li>The new file has an encoded filename, which Novelette can decode. This is
how Novelette knows that you used the script.</li>
<li>It declares that the file is at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm),
regardless of what it was originally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last item is tricky. The script does not change the number of pixels.
If the original file was 450x900 pixels, then the converted file will also be
450x900 pixels. So if the original file was designed at 300 pixels/inch,
it occupied 1.5x3 inches. But the converted file will only occupy
0.75x1.5 inches, because its pixels/inch (not pixel number) was changed.</p>
<p>Be sure to design your graphics at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm).</p>

<a id="tabdia"></a>
<h4>Tables and Diagrams : Use Images</h4>
<p>Novelette does not support tables, or vector diagrams. It is unlikely
that you will need them in a work of popular fiction. They would cause
problems with the typography of those things that you really need.</p>
<p>If you wish to print a table or diagram, create it as a raster <i>png</i>
image. Does not matter whether it was created using other TeX methods, or
a graphics program, or a word processor. Just be sure that it is converted
to <i>png</i> format at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm). Novelette is
intended for printing to paper, where everything has fixed size. Scalable
graphics are of no value.</p>


<a id="nogray"></a>
<h4>What, No Grayscale ?</h4>
<p>From the technical perspective, Novelette "could have" allowed grayscale
graphics, and most print-on-demand services would not care.</p>
<p>But grayscale graphics look poor unless you are printing to special paper
intended for that purpose. This is why most professionally-published books
print grayscale graphics on different paper, which is placed separately from
ordinary text. That printing technology is not available to you.</p>
<p>Look at popular fiction with graphics (map of an imaginary world, or
crime scene) and you will see that they are black/white line art. This method
print well, on the same paper (and possibly same page) as ordinary text.
That is what Novelette does.</p>

<a id="profile"></a>
<h4>What, no color profile ?</h4>
<p>Whether interior black/white, or color cover, no image will have an
<code>*.icc</code> color profile attached. The Novelette scripts ensure this.
Many print-on-demand manufacturers do not allow color profiles; those that
allow them, are likely to ignore them.</p>
<p>In the worst case, color profiles might trick the printers into doing
something unexpected.</p>
