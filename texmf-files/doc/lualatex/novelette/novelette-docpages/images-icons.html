<h4>Images vs. Icons</h4>
<p>In Novelette, the <code>\image</code> command places its content as a
block element, in its own paragraph. Using options, you may choose its
horizontal alignment, and vertical placement (float).</p>
<p>Wherever it is placed, an <code>\image</code> occupies an integer number of
text lines. Novelette automatically pads it, to preserve the surrounding line
grid.</p>
<p>The <code>\icon</code> command places its content inline, with other text.
It has no options. The width of the icon occupies that much space within
the text.</p>
<p>The height of an <code>\icon</code> is very limited, so that it fits on a
single line of text without pushing against the lines above or below it.</p>
<p>Images and icons cannot be used everywhere. See the command descriptions
for where they are allowed.</p>

<a id="fmtloc"></a>
<h4>File Format and Location</h4>
<p>Novelette allows only one graphics file format: <i>png</i>. If you attempt
to place any other format, or if you write a graphics filename without its
<i>png</i> file extension, an error results.</p>
<p>The graphics file may be located in the same directory (folder) as the main
document. Or, is may be located in a subdirectory relative to the main
document. But you may not use an absolute path, and you may not use
<code>../</code> to move up a directory. The purpose of this restriction
is to ensure that if you move or copy the folder containing the main document,
all of its content is moved or copied with it.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="fmtreq"></a>
<h4>Graphics File Specifications</h4>
<p>When not in final mode, Novelette does not inspect graphics files.
As long as they are <i>png</i> files with extension, they will be printed.
This allows you to defer final graphics processing until later.</p>
<p>However, be sure that the graphics files are at 600 pixels/inch
(232.22 pixels/cm). If they are not, then you will have a rude surprise when
the files are processed for final mode.</p>
<p>In final mode, Novelette will only permit <i>png</i> files that have been
pre-processed by script <code>mono4nvt</code>, as explained below. This
ensures that the files comply with stringent printing standards. If a file
was not processed by that script, then an error is issued, and the PDF
reverts to draft mode.</p>
<p>Inspecting <i>png</i> files takes time, so do not use final mode until your
writing and editing is close to completion.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="fake"></a>
<h4>Fake Graphics</h4>
<p>Novelette allows you to place "fake graphics" in draft mode.
A fake <code>\image</code> or <code>\icon</code> does not refer to an actual
<i>png</i> file. Instead, it reserves vertical or horizontal space, where you
will later place a real file. This allows you to continue writing, then do
the graphics later.</p>
<p>A fake image is displayed as a gray rectangle, of specified size. If the
real file is that size, then paragraphs and pagination will be preserved.
But if the real size is different, then paragraphs may reflow or
pagination may change.</p>
<p>If you use fake graphics in final mode, an error results.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>


<h4>Block-Element Images</h4>
<h5><code>\image[<i>position</i>]{<i>content</i>}</code></h5>
<p>The <code>\image</code> command places its content as a block element.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not use <code>\image</code> at the start, end, or midway in
a paragraph. The <code>\image</code> command must stand by itself.</li>
<li>You may not use <code>\image</code> inside any command that styles
text.</li>
<li>You may not use <code>\image</code> in header/footer or footnotes.</li>
<li>Design the image file at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm).</li>
<li>The <i>content</i> is either a <code>png</code> format image file
(with file extension), or an integer (for fake image).</li>
<li>The maximum width of an <code>\image</code> is the textblock width.
Its maximum height is the textblock height (not including header/footer).</li>
<li>Regardless of the image height, Novelette will automatically pad its top
or bottom, so that it occupies an integer number of text lines. This preserves
the line grid.</li>
<li>Optional <code>[position]</code> sets the horizontal and vertical image
placement. Possible codes are explained below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The optional <code>[position]</code> uses comma-separated <i>key=value</i>
pairs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>align=A</code> where A is one of <code>l c r o i</code>
(left, center, right, outside, inside). Default <code>c</code>.</li>
<li><code>float=F</code> where F is one of <code>h t b p n</code>
(here, top, bottom, page, nofloat). Default <code>h</code>, except forced
<code>n</code> within upperpage and display pages.</li>
<li>Choice <code>h</code> is identical to <code>ht</code>
(here, alterate t).</li>
<li>If <code>float=n</code>, and the image is too close to the bottom of its
page, then it moves to the following top, leaving blank lines behind.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="icon"></a>
<h4>Inline Icons</h4>
<h5><code>\icon{<i>content</i>}</code></h5>
<p>The <code>\icon</code> command places its content inline. Its width may be
as much as the textwidth, but in most cases an icon is much narrower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Design the icon file at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm).</li>
<li>You may use <code>\icon</code> in most locations, including styled text.
But you may not use it within <code>\init</code>.</li>
<li>The maximum height of an icon is <i>1.1em</i>, where the <i>em</i> size
refers to surrounding text. In main text, <i>em</i> is the <i>typesize</i>,
whether set by you or by default. In scaled text (such as <code>\name</code>),
<i>em</i> is also scaled.</li>
<li>The bottom of the icon is always placed at <i>0.26em</i> beneath the
baseline of surrounding text. This is slightly deeper than the descenders
of Swainson font.</li>
<li>At the maximum height of 1.1em, the top of an icon will rise 0.84em above
baseline. This is the height of accented uppercase letters in Swainson.</li>
<li>A fake icon is written as <code>\icon{N}</code> where N is a number >0
(may be decimal). This reserves width equal to <code>N</code>em.</li>
<li>You do not need to worry about an icon descending into the bottom margin,
because descenders are already taken into account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="mono"></a>
<h4>Processing with Script <code>mono4nvt</code></h4>
<p>Final mode requires that every <i>png</i> file be pre-processed
by script <code>mono4nvt</code>. This is a BASH command-line script. It does
not require special privileges, as long as you can read/write files.</p>
<p>To use this script, you must have program <i>GraphicsMagick</i> installed.
The script reads your <i>png</i> file, calls <i>GraphicsMagick</i>,
and produces a new <i>png</i> file with encoded file name. You must place this
new file into your document, not the original file.</p>
<p>This is what the script does:</p>
<ul>
<li>It removes any transparency (flattens), and coverts the file to monochrome
black/white space at 1-bit per pixel.</li>
<li>It removes private metadata. It does not attach a color profile.</li>
<li>The new file has an encoded filename, which Novelette can decode. This is
how Novelette knows that you used the script.</li>
<li>It declares that the file is at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm),
regardless of what it was originally. This is tricky. If the original file
was not designed at 600 pixels/inch, then it will print at the wrong size,
because the script relabels the file but does not rescale it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="tabdia"></a>
<h4>Tables and Diagrams : Use Images</h4>
<p>Novelette does not support tables, or vector diagrams. It is unlikely
that you will need them in a work of popular fiction. They would cause
problems with the typography of those things that you really need.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to print a table or diagram, create it as a raster <i>png</i>
image.</li>
<li>It does not matter how you produced the <code>png</code>. You may use
other TeX methods, or word processor to produce PDF, then convert to
<code>png</code> using a graphics program.</li>
<li>The <code>png</code> must be at 600 pixels/inch (232.22 pixels/cm).</li>
<li>Since Novelette prints to paper (not Ebooks), you do not need scalable
vector graphics.</li>
</ul>

<a id="nogray"></a>
<h4>What, No Grayscale ?</h4>
<p>From the technical perspective, Novelette "could have" allowed grayscale
graphics, and most print-on-demand services would not care.</p>
<p>But grayscale graphics look poor unless you are printing to special paper
intended for that purpose. This is why most professionally-published books
print grayscale graphics on different paper, which is placed separately from
ordinary text. That printing technology is not available to you.</p>
<p>Look at popular fiction with graphics (map of an imaginary world, or
crime scene) and you will see that they are black/white line art. The line art
prints well, on the same paper (and possibly same page) as ordinary text.
This is the method used by Novelette.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>

<a id="noicc"></a>
<h4>What, no color profile ?</h4>
<p>Whether interior black/white, or color cover, Novelette scripts will remove
and <code>icc</code> color profiles from the processed image files.</p>
<p>Many print-on-demand manufacturers do not allow color profiles; those that
allow them, are likely to ignore them.</p>
<p>In the worst case, color profiles might trick the printers into doing
something unexpected.</p>
