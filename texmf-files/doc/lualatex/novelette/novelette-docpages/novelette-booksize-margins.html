<h2>Book Size, Margins</h2>
<p>This page does not discuss cover artwork.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\booksize{w=W,h=H} % Width and Height.</code></p>
<p>The booksize setting is mandatory. There is no default size.
If you do not provide it, the compiler immediately exits with fatal error.
If you use Novelette for the cover, then you must use the same booksize
as you use for interior pages. Cover size is a different setting.</p>
<p>Book size is the width and height of finished interior pages. It is known
to book manufacturers as "trim size", because larger paper is fed into the
printing machine, then "trimmed" (cut) to final size during binding.
Your print service will offer you a choice of standard sizes. For popular
fiction always choose off-white (cream, creme) paper, never white.<p>
<p>The width W and height H must be written with units, such as <code>in</code>
or <code>mm</code>. Here are some popular size for print-on-demand:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\booksize{w=5.5in,h=8.5in}</code> is widely used in the USA
for this kind of book.</li>
<li><code>\booksize{w=129mm,h=198mm}</code> is a popular "B-Format" size
in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p>Novelette requires that the height be greater than, or equal to, the width.
Other than that, there is no sanity check on the size, other than they must
be measurable length.</p>
<p>Unless you know what you are doing, avoid the "Pocket Book" and
"Mass Market Paperback" small sizes. That kind of book is traditionally
printed in advance, in large quantity, then distributed as part of
mass marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Command: <code>\margins{t=T,o=O,b=B,i=I} % Top, Outside, Bottom, Inside.</code></p>
<p>The four margins define the non-printable area on each page. Everything
must fit within the rectangle bounded by the margins.</p>
<p>Careful: Some word processors place page headers within the top margin zone,
and place page footers within the bottom margin zone. That is NOT the meaning
of margins here. Your page headers and footers do not sit within the margin
zones.</p>
<p>Many print services (not all) require that the top, outside, and bottom
margins be at least 0.5in or 13mm. The also require that the inside margin,
at the book spine, be larger than that (by 0.125in or 3mm) to accomodate
binding glue.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\margins{t=.5in,o=.5in,b=.5in,i=.625in}</code> typical for USA.</li>
<li><code>\margins{t=13mm,o=13mm,b=13mm,i=16mm}</code> typical for UK.</li>
</ul>
