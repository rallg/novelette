<h2>Mode and Intent</h2>
<p>This page does not discuss cover artwork.</p>
<p>Command: \mode{choice} % draft, shade, final</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\mode{draft}</code> is the default. The PDF will not contain
metadata identifying it as PDF/X conformant. The internal PDF title will
have DRAFT prepended to the document title.</li>
<li><code>\mode{shade}</code> is draft mode, with shading added to the pages.
<ul>
<li>Margins are shaded gray.</li>
<li>The inside margin has a darker strip, indicating
the spine glue zone.</li>
<li>If header, the area between top of main text and
header baseline is shaded light gray. Note that the "top" of main text
is at the height of tallest Latin-1 characters, Aacute and Aring, even if
you do not use these characters.</li>
<li>The area between the final line of main text
and the bottom margin, is shaded light gray. If layout has a footer, then
this area includes all of the footer. If layout has no footer, then this
area is the height of main text descenders (or possibly slightly more).</li>
<li>If you use the \guides{} setting, up to four additional pairs of
rectangles may be added in the margins, at integral number of lines from
the top of main text. These are useful for designing a uniform vertical
appearance of such things as chapter openings. The guides do not force
anything to align.</li>
</ul>
<li><code>\mode{final}</code> is used when you are ready to publish.
<ul>
<li>If you set <code>\intent</code> to other than <code>none</code>,
the PDF will bear metadata identifying it as PDF/X-1a:2001.</li>
<li>During compile, images will be inspected for conformance.</li>
<li>If any image does not conform, or if there is an error,
then the mode will automatically revert to draft or shade.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: During Novelette development do not use final mode,
except for development testing. This line will be removed when ready.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Command: \intent{choice} % PDF/X Output Intent.
<p>Choices: none, SWOP, FOGRA39, JC200103, custom. Do not use custom unless
you have expertise. The custom format is described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\intent{none}</code> does not identify the PDF as PDF/X.</li>
<li>If mode is set to final, and the document compiles without error,
then the intent (other than none) is used as part of PDF/X conformace.</li>
<li>The associated <code>*.icc</code> color profile is NOT attached.</li>
</ul>

<p>Discussion: The "intent" is just that. It informs the print service that
the PDF was prepared according to certain specifications, that will produce
an expected result, if the actual printer matches the intent. But it does
not force the printer to honor the intent. In fact, the print service will
produce your book (interior and cover) according to its own methods,
which are not described by any widely-used intent. For black-ink interiors,
it does not matter. It might matter for color covers, but print-on-demand
does not guarantee color standards, so again it does not matter.</p>
