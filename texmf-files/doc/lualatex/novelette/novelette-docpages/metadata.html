<h2>Metadata Settings</h2>

<p>Metadata is non-printing information in the PDF. It tells printers and
PDF readers what to do. Some metadata is within your control, others not.</p>
<p>You are selling copies of the printed book, not copies of the PDF.
The book distribution database gets its information from whatever you provided
to the print service, not from the PDF metadata. This is why Ebook metadata,
such as "keywords", are not part of the PDF.</p>


<a id="title">
<h4>Title</h4>
<p>The final PDF must have a title that exactly matches whatever you
provided to the print distribution database. Best practice is to first
sign up with the intended title. If that is accepted, use it for your
book. The database may reject titles that are hard to understand,
appear to be unlawful, or contain some non-alphabetic characters. If you
create your book first, then its title is rejected, you must re-work it.</p>
<p>Many print services limit book titles to the Latin-1 character set.
Even if your service allows something else, Novelette limits the title
to Latin-1 characters. So if your title is not among the Western European
languages, you cannot use Novelette. (You may use other characters in the
main body text.)<p>
<p>Command: <code>\title{<i>Title of Your Book</i>}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The exact title must be used wherever it appears: cover, title page,
copyright page, and possibly running page headers. This requirement is
specific to print-on-demand.</li>
<li>Long titles are discouraged. If you do choose a long title, such as
"The Thirty Thousand Conspiracy Manifesto Rebellion", then it will not
look good in running page headers.</li>
<li>TeX treats some non-alphabetic characters as having special meaning.
These include the dollar, ampersand, numbersign, percent. If the print service
allows them in the title, you must use <code>\$ \& \# \%</code> with the
backslash. There are more special characters, but they are unlikely to appear
in a title.</li>
<li>Other than escaping special characters, do not use the backslash
anywhere in the title. This means you cannot use TeX macros such as
\^i to mean î (i with cirumflex). Instead, directly paste î from a character
map, because encoding is UTF-8.</li>
<li>Curly single and double quotes are not in Latin-1. You cannot use them
in the title. Use straight ' and " (although " might be disallowed).</li>
<li>Dashes (em dash, en dash) are not in Latin-1. Use a single hyphen,
or re-write the title to avoid dashes.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event that you mis-spelled the title when you signed up,
you have two choices: (1) Mis-spell the book to match. (2) Cancel the
mis-spelled title, and re-enrol with the correct spelling.</li>
<li>In draft mode, you may omit the title. Novelette will provide
"Untitled Document". But this is a fatal error in final mode.</li>
</ul>

<a id="author">
<h4>Author</h4>
<p>The final PDF must have an author name.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\author{<i>Author Name</i>}</code></p>
<p>All of the above requirements for title, also apply to author, with these
variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The author may be a pseudonym (pen name). Be sure to use your real name
as Copyright Holder, on the Copyright Page, so you can prove that author
"Joe Fakename" is "Really You", in case of copyright infringement.</li>
<li>If you use a pseudonym, it is a marketing tool. Do not imagine that
you can hide your identity with a pseudonym. Most jurisdictions do not
allow that, and in any case your identity is revealed by other means.</li>
<li>In draft mode, you may omit the author. Novelette will provide
"Anonymous Author". But this is a fatal error in final mode.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#uptitleauthor">^return</a></p>


<a id="subtitle">
<h4>Subtitle</h4>
<p>Your book does not require a subtitle. They are rarely used with fiction,
but widely used as a marketing tool for non-fiction.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\subtitle{<i>Subtitle of Book</i>}</code></p>
<p>If you use a subtitle, it must follow the rules for title, as described
above. However, you would normally not write the subtitle in running page
headers.</p>
<p class="return"><a href="#upsubtitle">^return</a></p>


<a id="mode">
<h4>Mode</h4>
<p>The mode setting is internal to Novelette. It tells the compiler how to
produce the PDF. There are three modes: <code>draft shade final</code>.
Default is <code>draft</code>.</p>
<p>All modes typeset text the same way. Line breaks, kerning, and pagination
are the same, so you can write in draft mode, then print in final mode.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\mode{<i>choice</i>}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of images may depend on mode.
This is <a href="images.html">described here</a>.</li>
<li>In <b>draft</b> mode, the internal PDF metadata will have DRAFT prepended
to the book title. This does not change the printed title.</p>
<li>The <b>shade</b> mode is also draft mode, but with some areas shaded gray,
so you can visualize alignment.
This is <a href="images/shade-noshade.html">illustrated here.</a></li>
<li>In <b>final</b> mode. Novelette performs several additional checks,
which consume additional time (especially if you use images). Final mode
is required for the PDF that you submit to the printer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upmode">^return</a></p>


<a id="intent">
<h4>Intent</h4>
<p>Some print services require files that conform to PDF/X. This is a format
that places restrictions on what the file must or must not contain.</p>
<p>Novelette will automatically produce PDF/X-1a:2001 files in final mode,
unless you request otherwise. Although there are several PDF/X formats,
you cannot choose another version.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\intent{<i>choice</i>}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>choice</i> is: <code>none SWOP FOGRA39 JC200103 custom</code>.</li>
<li>Choice <code>none</code> does not produce PDF/X. No matter what you set,
it will be <code>none</code> in draft mode.</li>
<li>Default is <code>SWOP</code>, which is an abbreviation for "U.S. Web Coated
(SWOP) v2", the USA standard. FOGRA39 (acutally FOGRA39L) is one of several
European standards. JC200103 is used in Japan.</p>
<li>A color profile (*.icc file) is not coded in the intent,
and will not be attached. This is how print-on-demand services want it.</li>
<li>Do not use a <code>custom</code> intent, unless you are required to use a
particular intent that is not one of the choices. Then,
then you will need to write <a href="customintent.html">more
settings</a> in Preamble, according to industry specifications.</li>
<li>Dirty little secret: Usually, the intent is ignored by the printer.
It is only important in commercial color offset printing, which is not the
technology that will be used for your book. But unless you do not use PDF/X,
you must set an intent, because it is part of the specification.</li>
</ul>
<p class="return"><a href="#upintent">^return</a></p>


<a id="applprod">
<h4>Application, Producer</h4>
<p>The "application" names the software used for writing. The "producer"
names the software used for conversion to PDF. They may be the same.
In most situations, the names are ignored. They do not matter.</p>
<p>You do not need to set either application or producer. They are
automatically set to <code>Novelette</code>.</p>
<p>In very rare instances, your PDF may be passed through a workflow that
requests a particular application or producer, perhaps as a means to ensure
that the PDF file is properly handled. Change them at your own risk.</p>
<p>Command: <code>\application{<i>application name</i>}</code></p>
<p>Command: <code>\producer{<i>producer name</i>}</code></p>
