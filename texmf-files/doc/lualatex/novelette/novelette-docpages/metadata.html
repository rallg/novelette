<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Metadata</i> is non-printing information in the PDF. It tells printers and
PDF readers what to do. Some metadata is within your control, others not.</p>
<p>You are selling copies of the printed book, not copies of the PDF.
The book distribution database gets its information from whatever you provided
to the print service, not from the PDF metadata. This is why Ebook metadata,
such as "keywords", are not part of the PDF. But title and author, as written
in PDF metadata, must exactly match whatever is in the distribution database.</p>


<a id="title"></a>
<h4><code>\title{<i>title of your book</i>}</code></h4>
<p>This is required for final mode (see below). If not in final mode, the
metadata will have a modified title, so that it is not confused with final
output.</p>
<p>The final PDF must have a title that exactly matches whatever you
provided to the print distribution database. Best practice is to first
sign up with the intended title. If that is accepted, use it for your
book. The database may reject titles that are hard to understand,
appear to be unlawful, or contain some non-alphabetic characters. If you
create your book first, then its title is rejected, you must re-work it.</p>
<p>Many print services limit book titles to the Latin-1 character set.
Even if your service allows something else, Novelette limits the title
to Latin-1 characters. So if your title is not among the Western European
languages, you cannot use Novelette. (You may use other characters in the
main body text.)<p>
<ul>
<li>The exact title must be used wherever it appears: cover, title page,
copyright page, and possibly running page headers. This requirement is
specific to print-on-demand.</li>
<li>Long titles are discouraged. If you do choose a long title, such as
"The Thirty Thousand Conspiracy Manifesto Rebellion", then it will not
look good in running page headers.</li>
<li>TeX treats some non-alphabetic characters as having special meaning.
These include the dollar, ampersand, numbersign, percent. If the print service
allows them in the title, you must use <code>\$ \& \# \%</code> with the
backslash. There are more special characters, but they are unlikely to appear
in a title.</li>
<li>Other than escaping special characters, do not use the backslash
anywhere in the title. This means you cannot use TeX macros such as
\^i to mean î (i with cirumflex). Instead, directly paste î from a character
map, because encoding is UTF-8.</li>
<li>Curly single and double quotes are not in Latin-1. You cannot use them
in the title. Use straight ' and " (although " might be disallowed).</li>
<li>Dashes (em dash, en dash) are not in Latin-1. Use a single hyphen,
or re-write the title to avoid dashes.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event that you mis-spelled the title when you signed up,
you have two choices: (1) Mis-spell the book to match. (2) Cancel the
mis-spelled title, and re-enrol with the correct spelling.</li>
<li>In draft mode, you may omit the title. Novelette will provide
"Untitled Document". But this is a fatal error in final mode.</li>
</ul>

<a id="author"></a>
<h4><code>\author{<i>Author of Book</i>}</code></h4>
<p>The final PDF must have an author name.
<p>All of the above requirements for title, also apply to author, with these
variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The author may be a pseudonym (pen name). But be sure to use your real name
as Copyright Holder, on the Copyright Page, so you can prove that author
"Joe Fakename" is "Really You", in case of copyright infringement.</li>
<li>If you use a pseudonym, it is a marketing tool. Do not imagine that
you can hide your identity with a pseudonym. Most jurisdictions do not
allow that, and in any case your identity is revealed by other means.</li>
<li>In draft mode, you may omit the author. Novelette will provide
"Anonymous Author". But this is a fatal error in final mode.</li>
</ul>

<a id="subtitle"></a>
<h4><code>\subtitle{<i>Subtitle of Book</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Your book does not require a subtitle. They are rarely used with fiction,
but widely used as a marketing tool for non-fiction.</p>
<p>If you use a subtitle, it must follow the rules for title, as described
above. However, you would normally not write the subtitle in running page
headers.</p>
<p>The subtitle, if any, is not written into PDF metadata. It is strictly a
marketing tool.</p>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>


<a id="mode"></a>
<h4><code>\mode{<i>setting</i>}</code></h4>
<p>The mode setting is internal to Novelette. It tells the compiler how to
produce the PDF. There are five modes: <code>draft shade typo typo*
final</code>. Default is <code>draft</code>.</p>
<p>All modes typeset text the same way. Line breaks, kerning, and pagination
are the same, so you can write in draft mode, then print in final mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of images may depend on mode.
This is <a href="images.html">described here</a>.</li>
<li><code>\mode{draft}</code> : Internal PDF metadata has DRAFT prepended
to the book title. This does not change the printed title.</p>
<li><code>\mode{shade}</code> : This is draft mode, with some areas shaded gray,
so you can visualize alignment. <a href="shade.html">Illustrated here.</a></li>
<li><code>\mode{typo}</code> : This is draft mode, with a variety of
typographic flaws shown in colored text, and described in a *.typo file.
<code>\mode{typo*}</code> is the same, except different coloration.
<a href="typomode.html">Details here.</a></li>
<li><code>\mode{final}</code> : For submission. Novelette performs several
additional checks, which consume additional time (especially if you use images).
So, do not use final mode until you are nearly finished.</li>
</ul>
<p class="top"><a href="#"><img src="resources/top.png" alt="top"/>top</a></p>


<a id="intent"></a>
<h4><code>\intent{<i>setting</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Some print services require files that conform to PDF/X. This is a format
that places restrictions on what the file must or must not contain.</p>
<p>Novelette will automatically produce PDF/X-1a:2001 files in final mode,
unless you request otherwise. Although there are several PDF/X formats,
you cannot choose another version.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\intent{none}</code> : Does not produce PDF/X.</li>
<li><code>\intent{SWOP}</code> : Produces PDF/X with Output Intent "U.S. Web
Coated (SWOP) v2". This is the default intent. It is often used in
the U.S.A.</li>
<li><code>\intent{FOGRA39}</code> : Produces PDF/X with Output Intent FOGRA39L.
Often used in Europe.</li>
<li><code>\intent{JC200103}</code> : Produces PDF/X with Output Intent JC200103.
Often used in Japan.</li>
<li>In any mode other than final, the intent is automatically changed
to <code>none</code>, and to PDF is not PDF/X.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shocking information: Output Intent pertains to color models used by offset
printers. But that is inapplicable to your book. Regardless of the stated
Output Intent, it will be ignored by the digital printers used for
print-on-demand. The only reason for including it, is because it is part
of the PDF/X specification.</p>
<p>Novelette does not attach a color profile (*.icc) to the Output Intent.</p>
