<h3 class="title">Special Pages</h3>

<a id="intro"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Most pages in <code>frontmatter</code> have a special style, that
distinguishes them from other pages: half-title, frontispiece, title,
copyright, dedication, contents, epigraph, acknowledgements/note.</p>
<p>Methods for styling these pages are described here, with examples.
<a href="chapter.html">Chapter openings</a> are descibed on another page.</p>

<a id="halftitle"></a>
<h4>Half-Title Page</h4>
<p>Usually, the half-title page is the first page of <code>frontmatter</code>.
It is recto, page <code>i</code> (roman numeral), without header/footer
(and thus no printed page number). It faces the inside of the front cover.</p>
<p>Historically, the book interior pages were printed by a business that did
nothing but print, then later bound into a book by another business that did
nothing but bookbinding. The half-title was a dust cover for the real title
page. Although that is obsolete, the practice continues.</p>
<p>The half-title page must contain nothing but the book title. No subtitle,
no author. It looks best when the title uses the same style (text or image)
as on the title page, but at size between ordinary text and the title page.</p>
<p>The half-title must sit within a <code>fullpage</code> environment. Here is
an example, where the title has been written on several lines, for pleasing
visual design:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
\begin{fullpage}<br>
\vfil<br>
\format[scale=1.6,font=light]{Excerpts}<br>
\format[scale=1.3,font=light]{from}<br>
\format[scale=1.6,font=light]{Mark Twain}<br>
\vfil\vfil<br>
\end{fullpage}
</code></div>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="resources/halftitle.png" style="height:300px" alt="half-title"/>
</p>
<p>In the above example, the default <code>\format</code> alignment is
horizontally centered. By using only one <code>\vfil</code> at top, but
two of them at bottom, the text is placed higher than mid-page.
The <code>font=light</code> assumes that the book title (on the title page)
also uses that font.</p>
<p>In some books, the half-title is repeated as the last recto page in
<code>frontmatter</code>. You may do that, if you wish.</p>



<h4><code>\dedication{<i>text</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a book does not need a dedication. But if you
wish to write one, it must be placed by itself, on the page that immediately
follows the copyright page.</p>
<p>The <a href="environments.html#fullpage"><code>fullpage</code></a>
environment will isolate the dedication, and ensure that no header or footer
appears there.</p>
<p>Novelette provides the <code>\dedication</code> command. Its text will be
centered horizontally, in Italics, at slightly larger than
normal size. This is the most common style used in books. But you may use
other methods to style it yourself. If the dedication is more than a few words,
use <code>\\</code> or <code>\br</code> to break the text into multiple
short lines.</p>
<p>Although it is very unusual, you may use <code>\image</code> and
<code>\icon</code> on the dedication page. Avoid using other styled text.</p>
<p>To position the dedication mid-page, use <code>\vfil</code> above and
below it. To raise it slightly above mid-page, write one or more
<code>\null</code> commands.</p>
<p>Example dedication:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<code>\begin{fullpage}<br>
\vfil<br>
\dedication{For Homies Everywhere}<br>
\null\null<br>
\vfil<br>
\end{fullpage}</code>
</div>


<a id="toc"></a>
<h4>Table of Contents</h4>
<p>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette has no provision for a
table of contents. You may design one yourself, but its chapter numbers and
page numbers are not automated: You must manually write them, after the rest
of the book has been typeset (so you know the numbers).</p>
<p>Unless your book is a collection of short stories, a table of contents
is discouraged.</p>
<p>If you use a table of contents, it is a recto page, which may flow to
a following verso. You may place the table immediately after the copyright
page, if you wish; but if there is a dedication, the table must come after
the dedication.</p>
<p>Novelette provides commands <code>\entry</code> and <code>\linespread</code>
to help you. Each entry is horizontally centered, with chapter and page
separated by three spaced dots. If there are few entries, the linespread can
move them apart. Or if the table flows to a second page with only a line or
two, the linespread can move more lines there.</p>
<p>Use <code>\format</code> to style the table title. Trick: Instead of
saying "Table of Contents" in your language, use the title of the book.</p>
<p>Example table of contents:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<code>\begin{fullpage}<br>
\null\null\null<br>
\linespread{1.2}<br>
\format[scale=1.7]{The Wonk, and Other Stories}<br>
\null<br>
\entry{Bread Pudding}{1}<br>
\entry{Homie Escapade}{24}<br>
\entry{Off the Rails}{53}<br>
\entry{The Wonk}{127}<br>
\end{fullpage}</code>
