<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>This page lists a few Preamble settings that are almost never used.
That is, Novelette has default values, which are almost always best.
Only use these settings if you need them, and understand what they do.</p>


<a id="myparindent"></a>
<h4><code>\myparindent{<i>length</i>}</code></h4>
<p>The default, global paragraph indent is 1em. If you need somthing else for
the global indent, this sets it. The <i>length</i> may be mearued in
<code>pt</code> or other units, but it is best to specify with <code>em</code>.
The value must be at least 0.8em. If you provide a setting that does not
make sense, or is too small, Novelette will ignore it, issue an alert, and
use 1em.</p>
<p>Local changes to paragraph indent are automatically handled by macros.
If they are incorrect in a particular situation, it is better to use
<code>\forceindent</code> or <code>\backindent</code> for one-time fix.</p> 


<a id="myroman"></a>
<h4><code>\myroman{<i>setting</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Your book probably will have no printed page numbers in frontmatter.
If you have a lot to say in frontmatter, enough to require visible page
numbers, they will use lowercase roman numerals (v, vi, vii, etc.) by default.</p>
<p>European purists say that the actual Romans did not have lowercase.
If you prefer to do what the Romans did, <code>\myroman{R}</code> will change
to uppercase Roman numerals (V, VI, VII, etc.). Anything other than
<code>R</code> will be ignored, and numerals remain lowercase.</p>
<p>This does not affect arabic page numbers in mainmatter.</p>


<a id="sheetfeed"></a>
<h4><code>\sheetfeed{<i>letter or A4</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Do not use the <code>\sheetfeed</code> setting, unless you are certain that
you need it. When you do not set it, Novelette will automatically create
PDF page size equal to the book trim size. This is how most manufacturers
want it.</p>
<p>If you are printing copies on your home printer, perhaps because you like
to edit with pen and ink: The printer may not know what to do, because its
paper is not the same as the requested print size (trimsize). In this case,
set sheetfeed to match the paper, either <code>letter</code>
or <code>A4</code>. That will center the print area in the paper.</p>
<p>Be sure that you do not use <code>\sheetfeed</code> for the final file
sent to the manufacturer, unless requested.</p>
<p>In final mode, using PDF/X (any <code>\intent</code> other than <code>none</code>),
the PDF will have an invisible TrimBox (part of PDF/X standards). This tells
software that the PDF size (sheetfeed) is not the same as the finished
size (trimsize).</p>
