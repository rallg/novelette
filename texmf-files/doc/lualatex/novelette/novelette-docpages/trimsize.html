<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>The <i>printer</i> is a machine that prints, or whoever operates the
machine. The <i>manufacturer</i> creates a finished object (your book)
with printed pages, glued together at spine, with cover. A "print-on-demand"
(POD) service is actually manufacture-on-demand, with distribution from
one or more factories to destinations.</p>
<p>A <i>page</i> is one side of a <i>leaf</i>.
Thus, every book necessarily has an even number of pages. Manufacturers count
every one of them, no matter how they are numbered (or not), even blanks.
The finished book may contain extra pages at the end, added by the
manufacturer as part of workflow. The final page, which faces the rear
cover, is always blank (although the manufacturer may add something there).</p>
<p>The <i>trim size</i> is the width and height of the book interior pages.
With most softcover technology, that is also the size of the finished book.
But in the case of library hardcover books, trim size refers to the pages,
and the cover is slightly larger.</p>
<p>The most common method of softcover POD is named "Perfect Print"â„¢.
When the pages are glued together, and the cover is attached, all of it is
slightly over-size. Then the entire assembly is <i>trimmed</i> to final size,
This is why such books have all pages and cover so precisely aligned.</p>


<a id="trimsize"></a>
<h4><code>\trimsize{w=<i>width</i>,h=<i>height</i>}</code></h4>
<p>You must set trimsize. There is no default, because it it the most
important setting.</p>
<p>Width and height must be specified with units of <code>in</code> (inches)
or <code>mm</code> (millimeters). You must provide actual values.
Novelette does not offer you a choice of size names.</p>
<p>Here a some popular (and suggested) choices:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\trimsize{w=5.5in,h=8.5in}</code> % U.S.A.</p>
<p class="code"><code>\trimsize{w=135mm,h=210mm}</code> % British B-Format.</p>
<p>Choose only a standard size, offered by the manufacturer, with off-white
paper. Off-white paper may be known as "creme" or "cream".</p>
