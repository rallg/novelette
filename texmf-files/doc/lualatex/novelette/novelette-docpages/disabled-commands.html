<h2 class="title">Disabled Commands</h2>

<p>Novelette disables the use of many LaTeX commands or environments.
This page lists a number of them. There may be others, but LaTeX has numerous
commands, many of them specific to certain packages, so it is not possible
to list them all.</p>

<p>Math Mode - The dollar symbol ($) prints as dollar symbol. It does not
invoke math mode. Other methods for entering math mode are also disabled.</p>

<p>Environments: list, equation, table, XXXXX are all disabled.</p>

<p>Text effects: bold, underline, strikeout, color, are disabled.</p>

<p>Size commands such as \small and \large are all disabled. You may use
\smalltext in fullpage, legal, and upperpage environments. You may
scale text (relative to normal size) in \name, \subname, and
\format<i>X</i> commands.
</p>

<p>Graphics: \includegraphics is disabled. Use \image or \icon instead.
You cannot use \caption. You cannot apply image transforms such as reflection
or scale. You cannot use \graphicspath, because the path to any image or icon
is always relative to the main document (even if requested by subdoc),</p>

<p>Environments: Novelette only recognizes the environments
<a href="environments.html">described here</a>.</p>
<p>Among the standard LaTeX environments <i>not</i> recognized:
abstract, array, description, displaymath, enumerate, eqnarray, equation,
figure, itemize, labeling, list, math, minipage, picture, quotation, quote,
tabbing, table, tabular, theorem, titlepage, verbatim, verse.</p>

<p>Commands: Novelette does not recognize many standard LaTeX commands.
Among them: \part, \chapter, \section, \subsection, \subsubsection, \paragraph,
\subparagraph, \appendix, \makeindex, \maketitle, \theindex, \tableofcontents,
\listoftables, \listoffigures, \caption, \index.</p>
<p>Commands involving bold, underline, strikethrough are disabled.</p>
