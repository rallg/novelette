INTENT

\intent{choice}

Choices: none, SWOP, FOGRA29, JC200103

If mode is set to final, and the document compiles without error,
then the intent will be used as part of PDF/X conformace.

\intent{none} does not write PDF/X metadata into the file.

Any other intent will specify the PDF/X Output Intent using
industry standard description strings. The *.icc color profile
will NOT be attached.

Discussion: The "intent" is just that. It informs the print service that
the PDF was prepared according to certain specifications, that will produce
an expected result, if the actual printer matches the intent. But it does
not force the printer to honor the intent. In fact, the print service will
produce your book (interior and cover) according to its own methods,
which are not described by any widely-used intent. For black-ink interiors,
it does not matter. It might matter for color covers, but print-on-demand
does not guarantee color standards, so again it does not matter.
