Novelette does not allow you to use common LaTeX commands that would make
text larger or smaller. If you write \small{text} or \Large{text},
the text will print at normal size. The commands are simply ignored.

This is necessary to preserve the line grid. Also, popular fiction has
no need of text sizing, except in special locations.

Footnotes are automatically sized smaller than main text. You have no control
over that size.

On display pages, and in the opening environment, you may use the
\textscale command. If you attempt to use \textscale in main text,
or header, an error results.

\textscale[halign]{scale}{text to be scaled} % Defaults c, 1, empty.

You may only apply \textscale to a single line of text. It includes the
\par line ending. If you wish to scale multiple lines, you must use the
command multiple times, once for each line. Thus, scaled text is never
justified. You may center it, or align it left or right.

The required {scale} is a number, not less than 0.8, not greater than 6.
The optional [halign] is one of l, c, r, for left, center, right.

The scaled text is usually not on a baseline. But the scaled text, plus the
space above and below it, combine to an integral number of lines. Thus, the
following text (if normal size) will be on-baseline.

If the scale is <=1, the text is scaled, with no change to baseline.
If the scale is >1, then extra vertical space is added above and below
the scaled text. This is an automatic calculation. You may discover that
a certain scale displaces N lines of ordinary text, but a slightly larger
scale jumps to N+1 lines. This is necessary to preserve the line grid.

Use \textscale for things such as chapter titles, book title and author,
and anywhere else you need it (but not main text). Within the scaled text,
you may use \ital, \drama, and most other Novelette text commands.

You cannot place an image within \textscale.

You cannot nest one \textscale inside another \textscale.
