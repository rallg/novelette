This shows how Novelette handles an interior image. The processing
uses \mono{bash} command line, with ImageMagick installed.

1. Copy the image-test directory to your home directory, where you
have read/write privileges. Do not attempt to use it where it is installed.

2. Also copy directory novelette-scripts to your home directory.

3. Copy testimage.png into novelette-scripts. Open a Terminal
there, and process the image:

\mono{bash mono4nvt testimage.png}

4. That produces a new image, testimage-nvtmN.png, where N is several
digits. The exact N may depend on your version of ImageMagick. Transfer this
image into the image-test directory.

5. Compile this file: \mono{lualatex image-test}

6. The resulting PDF is in draft mode, which allows unprocessed images.
You will see the original testimage.png here:

\image{testimage.png}

7. Near the top of this image-test.tex file, change the mode from
draft to final. Compile this file again. This time, the compiler will throw
an error. That is because the original testimage.png was not processed
by script.

8. Now edit this file, and change the image filename
to whatever filename was produced by the script. Compile again, in final
mode. This time, the processed image is accepted. The PDF conforms to
PDF/X-1a:2001 with default SWOP Output Intent.
