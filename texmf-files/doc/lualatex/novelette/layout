LAYOUT

\layout{hgap=H,fgap=F,num=P,style=S}

The \layout command requires 4 arguments. You may leave any of them empty,
but you must use all of the braces. An empty argument will use its default.

header gap H
	This is a decimal number from 0 to 1. Default value .5.
Provides extra line space between header and main text. Ignored if no header.
Value 0 would place the header at the line immediately above mian text.
That is not a practical setting. Value 1 places a full blank line between
header and main text. That is practical for larger books. Default value .5 is
a compromise, suitable for smaller books.

footer gap F
	Similar to header gap. Provides extra space between main text and footer.

page numerals P
	This value is one or two letters: one of l|o|m possibly with i.
Value l uses lining numerals (default).
Value o uses oldstyle numerals.
Value m uses whichever style is used for main text.
Value i uses italics, instead of erect.
	Note that these values do not determine whether page numbers are
roman (frontmatter) or arabic (mainmatter). They only determine how printed
page numbers appear. Swainson has all of the above styles, but if you choose
a different main font that does not have a style, then the numerals will be
in whatever style the font offers.

page style S
	This is an integer 1-7, chosen from a style menu. It determines whether
pages have header and/or footer. If header, it also determines alignment.
Default page style is 2, with header and footer centered. Small book sizes
might look better with a different choice.

Examples:
\layout{hgap=1,num=i}
	The header gap is 1. Footer gap is default .5. Page numbers are italic,
with default numerals (same as main text). Page style is default 2.
\layout{pn=oi,style=4}
	Header and footer gaps are default .5. Numerals are oldstyle italic.
Page style is 4, which has no footer, so the footer gap is ignored.
