This is an example of how to produce a PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant file,
from an ordinary image of the correct cover size. These instructions are
for a computer with the \mono{bash} command line, and ImageMagick installed.

1. Copy this novelette-demo directory to your home directory, where you
have read/write privileges. Do not attempt to process these files where
they are originally installed, because you probably cannot write files there.

2. Copy the novelette-scripts directory to your home directory.

3. Transfer file samplecover.jpg from novelette-demo into novelette-scripts.
Launch a Terminal there, and process the image. Command:

\mono{bash cmyk4nvt samplecover.jpg}

4. That takes a few moments. When it is done, you will have two new images
there. One of them is named samplecover-softproof.jpg. You may compare it
to the original samplecover.jpg in any image viewer. Notice how the colors
are slightly dull, and the dark areas are less dark, in the softproof.
This emulates how the image will look as a printed cover.
	The other image is samplecover-nvtcN.jpg, where N is a multi-digit number.
The number may depend on which version of ImageMagick you used. This is
in CMYK color space. Image viewers will not show you accurate colors.
That is because their method for viewing CMYK uses a generic transform that
is incorect for this type of image.

5. Transfer the samplecover-nvtcN.jpg image into the novelette-demo
directory. You may keep or discard the softproof.

5. At the top of this novelette-samplecover.tex file, add the [cover]
document class option, and change the coverimage filename to whatever was
produced by the script. It is important to use that exact filename, with its
jpg extension.

6. Then process this tex file:

\mono{lualatex samplecover}

\null

7. The resulting PDF is the cover image, PDF/X-1a:2001 with SWOP Output Intent.
You may view it in a PDF reader, but its colors will appear wrong.
This is because the PDF reader is not emulating a printer.
A few PDF readers (possibly Adobe Reader) may be able to diagnose the PDF,
and apply a suitable color transform.
But do not rely on what you see. Only the softproof shows the transform.

8. Almost certainly, you are not using color-managed software with a computer
monitor that has been calibrated and profiled. The print emulation (softproof)
will appear slightly different, when viewed on different devices. Some devices
automatically enhance colors, to make them appear more vivid.
If the softproof is not noticeably duller than the original,
it means your device uses color enhancement. This does not affect how the
PDF will print.
