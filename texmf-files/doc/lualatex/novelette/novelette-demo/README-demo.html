<a id="demo"></a>
<h4>Full Interior Demo</h4>
<p>For a demonstration, copy this entire <i>novelette-demo</i> folder to
a place where you have file write privilege.</p>
<p>Compile <i>demo.tex</i>. On command line:</p>
<p class="code"><code>lualatex demo</code></p>
<p>That will produce the PDF, the usual TeX log file, and a special
<i>demo-summary.log</i> file with interesting information (read it).</p>


<a id="sub"></a>
<h4>Subdocs</h4>
<p>To see how subdocs work: Enter the various subfolders.
Each *.tex file is a subdoc. Compile them one by one. Some of them
have Preamble commands that show different results when compiled
alone, or compiled in the main document. But the paragraph and
page breaks are always the same.</p>


<a id="cover"></a>
<h4>Cover Image</h4>
<p>To see how a cover image may be processed, you need program GraphicsMagic
(a command-line-image processor), and the BASH command shell. It is available
on Linux and Mac. If you are on Windows 10 or later, use the Linux subsystem
for this. If you are on Windows &lt;10, or do not have its Linux subsystem,
then this procedure will not work.</p>
<p>Copy all of folder <i>novelette-scripts</i> to a writeable location.
In the demo <i>cover</i> folder is image file <i>riverboat.jp2</i>.
You may or may not be able to view it as-is, but this is unimportant.
Copy this image file into <i>novelette-scripts</i>, then process:</p>
<p class="code"><code>bash cmyk4nvt riverboat.jp2</code></p>
<p>That takes awhile. It produces two files: <i>riverboat-softproof.jpg</i> and
<i>riverboat-nvtcN.jpg</i> (where N is several digits). The softproof file
shows what the image will look like, when printed to paper (more or less).
You may discard it, if you wish. Move the <i>riverboat-nvtcN.jpg</i> file into
the demo <i>cover</i> folder. Edit file <i>demo-cover.tex</i>
so that <i>\coverimage</i> is the exact name of the new image file.
Then compile:</p>
<p class="code"><code>lualatex demo-cover</code></p>
<p>That is very fast. The resulting PDF is PDF/X-1a:2001 format, with Output
Intent "U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2", without attached icc color profile.</p>
<p>If you view the riverboat-nvtcN.jpg file in an image viewer, or view the
PDF in a PDF reader, the colors you see are likely to be wrong. They may
be much more colorful than you saw in the softproof. This is because most
viewers and readers do not apply the correct color transform, when coverting
the CMYK image (for printing) to RGB (for screen display).</p>
