Excerpts from Mark Twain\br/ Samuel Clemens\par
Mark Twain is the pseudonym of American\br
author Samuel Clemens (1835--1910)\par
The text and image are in the Public Domain\br
of the United States of America, and of nations\br
subscribing to the Berne Copyright Convention,\br
due to passage of time (over 100 years) since\br
initial publication and the death of its author.\par
This is largely a work of humorous satire.\par

This is a demonstration of the Novelette document
class, compiled with the LuaLaTeX typesetting engine.
The words of Samuel Clemens have been edited for flow and appearance.
None of this should be used as literary reference.\par
\forceindent Novelette is intended for original popular fiction, rather than
non-fiction or reprint of older works. Thus, this demo is outside the intended
genres. Why \ital{original} popular fiction? Then, when paragraphs are ugly,
or page breaks are awkward, you may simply re-write your own work.
But if you must duplicate the words of someone else, then there will be places
with bad typesetting, and Novelette cannot help you.\par 
\forceindent The Novelette documentation has a ``novelette-demo'' folder.
File ``demo.tex'' produces this \medcap{PDF}.\par
