The useful-info folder might contains things such as the short biography
of Samuel Clemens, a description of riverboats, more information
regarding James Fenimore Cooper, and whatever.


This is also a good place to put descriptions of characters, timeline
of events, geographic details, and other material needed to ensure
that your story has "continuity".
