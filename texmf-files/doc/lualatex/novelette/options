CLASS OPTIONS

Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette does not use class options
to set font size, book size, or anything else. All of these values are set
by commands in Preamble. Anything that you do not set, will have a default
value.

There is only one class option, which has not yet been implemented: cover.
Until it is implemented (if ever), it makes no difference whether or not
you use this option.

Class option "cover" is reserved for possible use with cover artwork.
