<h2>Novelette Document Class</h2>

<h4>This is an introduction. Full documentation begins
<a href="novelette-docpages/index.html">ON ANOTHER PAGE</a>.</h4>

<h3>What is Novelette?</h3>
<p>Novelette is a document class, with support files, created as a "package"
for TeX typesetting software. At the time you read this, Novelette is still
in its development stage, so it is not yet distributed by TeXlive or CTAN.</p>
<p>The master development site is "github.com/rallg/novelette".</p>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Novelette does only one thing: Printed non-technical books, such as popular
fiction (detective novels, historical romance, and the like). It is structured
for the needs of print-on-demand, with interior pages using only black ink.</p>
<p>It does not support Ebooks, mathematics, graphic novels, or academics.
This distinguishes it from nearly all other software available for TeX.</p>
<p>You may include raster images, but not vector drawings.</p>

<h3>What does it need?</h3>
<p>You need a working TeX installation, with LuaTeX support, and a variety of
other packages. Even a small TeX setup is likely to have most or all of it.
Anything missing can be added via your TeX package manager.</p>
<p>Novelette is not a graphics program. But if you have a color cover image,
and need it as CMYK PDF/X-1a:2001 format, Novelette can help. This requires
ImageMagick.</p>

<h3>How much TeX do I need to know?</h3>
<p>The less, the better. Novelette does not implement many standard TeX
commands. This is intentional. If you have already used TeX for academic work,
then you will need to stop doing whatever you did for your research papers.</p>
<p>Novelette has a small set of commands, targeted to its intended purpose.
Although TeX experts can add more, popular fiction has little need of more.</p>

<h3>What languages does it support?</h3>
<p>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish. Some have options. That's it.</p>
