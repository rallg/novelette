<a id="whatis"></a>
<h4>What is Novelette?</h4>
<p>Novelette is a document class, with support files, created as a "package"
for TeX typesetting software. It is new in TeX Live 2024.</p>
<p>The master development site is "github.com/rallg/novelette".</p>

<a id="whatdo"></a>
<h4>What does it do?</h4>
<p>Novelette does only one thing: Printed, original popular fiction
(detective novels, historical romance, and the like). It is structured
for the needs of print-on-demand, with interior pages using only black ink.</p>
<p>You may include raster images. You may create a color cover, if you have
additional graphics support.</p>

<a id="whatnotdo"></a>
<h4>What does it <i>not</i> do?</h4>
<p>Available commands and features are very limited, for the intended usage.
Novelette does not support Ebooks, mathematics, graphic novels, or academics.
You may not include vector drawings, or other PDF files.</p>
<p>This distinguishes Novelette from nearly all other LaTeX packages.
Requests for new features are strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>For best typesetting, you will need to edit and rewrite parts of your book,
as you go along. This is why Novelette is intended for <i>original</i> fiction,
where you are free to rewrite anything. If you are trying to reprint someone
else's work, then you should use something other than Novelette.</p>

<a id="whatneed"></a>
<h4>What does it need?</h4>
<p>You need a working LaTeX installation, with LuaTeX support, and a variety of
other packages. Even a small TeX setup is likely to have most or all of it.
Anything missing can be added via your TeX package manager.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your book has images, or if you wish to use Novelette to process a cover,
then you will need the GraphicsMagick program. This is not part of TeX,
but it is free for Linux, Windows, and Mac.</li>
<li>You will need a PDF reader, to view the result of your work. If you are
using Linux, the Evince (document viewer) program has the capability to update
an opened PDF when you edit the TeX document. The two-window TeXworks program
also has this capability, on all platforms. So does some other software.</li>
<li>No matter what you use to view the PDF as you write, view the final result
on Windows or Mac using Adobe Acrobat Reader (the free version is enough).
Reason: Adobe Acrobat is likely to be the software used for screening the PDF,
when it it is submitted for printing. If you do not have Windows or Mac,
or no Adobe Reader, find a friend or library that has it.</li>
</ul>

<a id="howlua"></a>
<h4>How much Lua do I need to know?</h4>
<p>None. The Lua code is all invisible to you.</p>

<a id="howtex"></a>
<h4>How much LaTeX do I need to know?</h4>
<p>The less, the better. Novelette does not implement many standard LaTeX
commands. This is intentional. If you have already used TeX for academic work,
then you will need to stop doing whatever you did for your research papers.</p>
<p>Novelette has a small set of commands, targeted to its intended purpose.
Although TeX experts can add more, popular fiction has little need of more.</p>

<a id="whatlang"></a>
<h4>What languages does it support?</h4>
<p>English, French, German, Italian, Catalan, Spanish. Some have options.
That's it.</p>

<a id="howsetup"></a>
<h4>How can I check my setup?</h4>
<p>First, be sure that you have a working LuaLaTeX installation with Novelette
installed. Compile this test document. You may load it into TeXworks
(compiler will be lualatex) or use <code class="nowrap">lualatex test</code>
on command line. Copy and save as file <code>test.tex</code> :</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>
% !TeX TS-program = lualatex<br>
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</a><br>
\documentclass{novelette}<br>
\begin{document}<br>
Hello, World.<br>
\end{document}
</code></div>
<p>If that works, then you are ready. But if that did not work, then you will
not be able to proceed without fixing it.</p>
<p>Although it is not always necessary, you will get additional capability if
you also install package <code class="nowrap">libertinus-fonts</code> using
your TeX package manager.</p>

<a id="writing"></a>
<h4>How to write?</h4>
<p>You may use a plain-text editor, or word processor.</p>
<ul>
<li> Advantage of a word processor is spelling check, automated smart quotes,
and (often) a menu for choosing special characters (with diacriticals).</li>
<li>Novelette does not understand mathematical symbols, so avoid using a TeX
GUI program that is intended for mathematics.</li>
<li>In all cases, the <code>*.tex</code> documents must be plain text,
encoded UTF-8, without BOM (byte order mark). Nowadays, this is the default
plain text exported by most programs. Be sure that a word processor
did not insert any of its own program codes.</li>
</ul>

<a id="wherestart"></a>
<h4>Where do I start?</h4>
<p>Ready to write? Then start with the
<a href="novelette-docpages/overview.html">Overview</a> and continue through
the documentation.</p>
<p>If you have used LaTeX before, or have been reading the online documentation
for other packages, you may have seen many commands that Novelette
does not use. So before decorating your story with numerous commands
that will not work, see if the ones you want are listed in the
<a href="novelette-docpages/index.html">Index</a>.<br>
