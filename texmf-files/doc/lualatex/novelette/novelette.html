<h2>Novelette Document Class</h2>

<h4>This is an introduction. Full documentation is
<a href="novelette-docpages/index.html">HERE</a>.</h4>

<h3>What is Novelette?</h3>
<p>Novelette is a document class, with support files, created as a "package"
for TeX typesetting software. At the time you read this, Novelette is sitill
in its development stage, so it is not yet distributed by TeXlive or CTAN.</p>
<p>The master development site is "github.com/rallg/novelette".</p>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Novelette does only one thing: Printed non-technical books, such as popular
fiction (detective novels, historical romance, and the like). It is structured
for the needs of print-on-demand, with interior pages using only black ink.</p>
<p>It does not support Ebooks, mathematics, graphic novels, or academics.
This distinguishes it from nearly all other software available for TeX.</p>

<h3>What does it need?</h3>
<p>You need a working TeX installation, with LuaTeX support, and a variety of
other packages. Even a small TeX setup is likely to have most or all of it.
Anything missing can be added via your TeX package manager.</p>
<p>Novelette is not a graphics program. But if you have a color cover image,
and need it as CMYK PDF/X-1a:2001 format, Novelette can help. This requires
ImageMagick.</p>

<h3>How much TeX do I need to know?</h3>
<p>The less, the better. Novelette does not implement many standard TeX
commands. This is intentional. If you have already used TeX for academic work,
then you will need to stop doing whatever you did for your research papers.</p>
<p>Novelette has a small set of commands, targeted to its intended purpose.
Although TeX experts can add more, popular fiction has little need of more.</p>

<h3>Is there a Quick Start, before reading all documentation?</h3>
<p>Yes! Install Novelette, then look in its documentation directory.
It is doc/lualatex/novelette relative to your texmf (or texmf-local,
or texmf-dist) directory.</p>
<p>Copy folder "novelette-demo" to your home directory, or other location
where you have file read/write privileges. Enter novelette-demo, and compile
"novelette-playground.tex" using LuaLaTeX. If you are using a GUI program,
such as TeXworks, it should automatically invoke LuaLaTeX when it reads the
top of the file. If you are using command line, use one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lualatex novelette-playground</code></li>
<li><code>luahbtex --format=lualatex novelette-playground</code></p>
</ul>
<p>If it responds with a message, stating that some package is missing,
then you must install that package. If it responds with a message stating
that it cannot find Swainson or Towhee fonts, then stop, and run this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>luaotfload-tool --cache=erase<br>luaotfload-tool -u</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first time you run Novelette, it may hesitate at the point where it
must look for certain components. This is normal. After it finds them,
it will not hesitate again.</p>
<p>After a successful build of the original playground file, you may use
a plain text editor to change the various settings in its Preamble.
Pay particular attention to change of mode. Possible changes are suggested
next to the settings, so you do not need to find them in documentation.</p>
<p>You may also play with parts of the main body text. There is an included
image, pre-formatted for the needs of Novelette. But if you wish to add
your own image, it will be rejected, until it has been processed by script.
That processing is not performed by TeX.</p>
<p>If you choose a bad setting, Novelette will intercept it, and provide
a (hopefully) helpful error message. A fatal error will stop the compiler.
A non-fatal error may sometimes allow the compiler to continue, but the
resulting PDF will not be in final mode.</p>
<p>If you make a syntax error, then TeX itself may issue an error that
is hard to understand. Novelette cannot help you. If this happens, review
whatever you just typed in the playground, and look for things such as
missing (or extra) braces, mis-spelled commands, and other typing errors.</p>
<p>Once you are comfortable in the playground, then you are ready to read
the documentation, and write your book.</p>
