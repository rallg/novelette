Novelette has its own commands for fonts.
DO NOT \usepackage{font}.


Novelette comes with its own Swainson and Towhee font families.
They are pre-set: Swainson is the main font, and Towhee is used in footnotes.
They are designed for use in popular fiction, with commerical usage allowed.
Unless you have a particular reason to use a different font, try this default.

To change the main font:

\typeface[open type features}{Font Family Name}

The \typeface command merely stores the setting for later, internal use.

The default font size is calculated from the available text width,
with minimum 11pt and maximum 12pt. But you may set it yourself:

\typesize{value}
Where the value may be decimal, with units pt or bp.
A typical value is 11.4pt, for 5.5in x 8.5in books.

The default lines per page is calculated from the font size and the
available vertical text height (not including header/footer).
For many books, this will fall in the range 30-35. But you may set it yourself:

\lines{integer}

After the typeface, typesize, and lines have been set (or defaults used),
novelette will determine whether they fit together. If they do not,
then an error is issued, and you will need to change something.


Swainson is specifically designed for use in popular fiction. It is roughly
in the same category as Caslon/Bembo/Garamond fonts, but is not derived
from any of those, and is not a historical revival.

Towhee is essentially the same as Swainson, but with is glyphs tweaked
for better appearance when used at the smaller scale of footnotes.

Although Swainson and Towhee have "Bold" fonts, they are actually duplicates
of the non-Bold fonts. To put that another way: If you request Bold or
BoldItalic, you get ordinary Regular or Italic. This is a work-around for
software that will synthesize or substitute missing bold fonts, which is
not appropriate. You do not need Bold in popular fiction.

For special purpose, you may add up to three other fonts:

The "altfont" is a family (with Italics, etc.) that may be used for providing
characters that are not in the main font. For example, if you need
the occasional Greek letter, and the main font is Swainson, then
you will need to get the Greek letter from an alternate font.
Libertinus Serif is a good choice.
In Preamble:
\altfont[features]{Font Family Name}
In body:
\alt{This text is in the altfont.}

The "dramafont" family may be used on display pages
when you need something unusual. For example, the book title page may have
the title printed with specially-designed letters.
In Preamble:
\dramafont[features]{Font Family Name}
In body, only on a display page:
\drama{Dramatic Text}

The "decofont" is a single font file, that may be used for special effects
such as dingbats or other decorations.
In Preamble:
\decofont[features]{Font Name}
In body, only on a display page:
\deco{Decorative Elements}


In addition to the above, the sans font and mono font (typewriter font)
are pre-defined. You may cheat: The sans font does not actually have to be
sans-serif, and the mono font does not actually have to be monospace.
So, you can use these as two more font choices:
In Preamble:
\sansfont[features]{Font Family Name}
\monofont[features]{Font Family Name}
In body:
\sans{This text is in the sans font, not necessarily sans-serif.}
\mono{This text is in the mono font, not necessarily monospace.}
The typesetting algorithm may not apply kerning or microtype adjustment
to the mono font.
