Novelette has limited capability for footnotes, as used in popular fiction.

Footnotes are not numbered. Instead, they are marked using asterisk, dagger,
daggerdbl, section. In the main text these markers appear as superscripts.
In the footnote text, they have ordinary appearance.

Each opening re-sets the markers to asterisk. If there are more than four
footnotes prior to the next opening, then the next set of markers is
double-asterisk, double-dagger, double-daggerdbl, double-section.
If more than eight, the markers reset to asterisk.

If a footnote is placed on a display page, or within an opening, then
there is no marker. This technique is sometimes used for providing a
general comment that does not pertain to any particular sentence.

If you have many footnotes, or need numbered footnotes, then Novelette
is not an appropriate document class.
