MODE

\mode{choice}


Unless creating a cover, Novelette has three modes: draft, shade, final

draft
	This is the default. In draft mode, the PDF will not contain metadata
identifying it as PDF/X, regardless of other settings. Also, the metadata title
will have DRAFT prepended, so that the draft PDF is not confused with
a final PDF.

shade
	This is draft mode, with added shading. Margins are shaded gray.
At the inside (spine), the extra margin width is shaded darker gray.
	If the layout has header, then the area between top of main text,
and baseline of header, is shaded light gray. The "top of main text" is at
the height of the tallest Latin-1 characters (Aacute, Aring) whether or not
you use these characters.
	The area between the final line of main text (whether or not occupied),
and the bottom margin, is shaded light gray. If layout has a footer, then
this area includes all of the footer. If layout has no footer, then this
area is theheight of main text descenders (or possibly slightly more).
	The left and right margins have small rectangles marking the top line
of main text. Base of rectangles is at the text baseline. Top of rectangles
is at the lowercase x-height.
	If you use the \guides{} setting, up to four additional pairs of
rectangles may be added in the margins, at integral number of lines from
the top of main text. These are useful for designing a uniform vertical
appearance of such things as chapter openings. The guides do not force
anything to align.


final
	If you set \intent to other than none, the PDF will bear metadata
identifying it as PDF/X-1a:2001. During compile, images will be inspected
for conformance.
	However, if any image does not conform, or if there is an error,
then the mode will automatically revert to draft or shade.
	During pre-alpha development, do not use final mode, except for testing.
